      <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
      <div class="subtitle">Last updated on 17th October 2016</div>
      <div class="text_section">
        <p>The Mineunit Group LP company, hereinafter referred to as the "Administrator", on the one hand, and an individual purchaser of the Equipment, hereinafter referred to as the "User", on the other hand, have concluded this agreement (hereinafter - the "Agreement") on the following</p>
      </div>
      <!-- end .text_section-->
      
      <div class="text_section">
        <h2>I. General Provisions</h2>
        <p>1. The Equipment is being produced at the moment, therefore the Administrator offers Users to make preliminary orders under special conditions specified in the Agreement. This is aimed at stimulating the production and optimization of the Equipment.</p>
        <p>2. The User according to his purposes and tasks can purchase the Equipment from the Administrator under conditions specified in this Agreement.</p>
        <p>3. The User undertakes to register for an account on the Platform, providing the Administrator with all the necessary information.</p>
        <p>4. Although the User obtains the Equipment, all the intellectual rights belong to the Administrator and may not be violated by the User. </p>
        <p>5. The Parties guarantee each other that they have all the legal competence to perform all the actions necessary to implement Art. 1-2 Section I of this Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <!-- end .text_section-->
      
      <div class="text_section">
        <h2>II. Definitions</h2>
        <p>"Equipment" means mining and distributed computing equipment, which is produced, optimized and sold by the Administrator.</p>
        <p>"Platform" means the Administrator's hardware-software complex, based on smart contracts and blockchain technology, which is used to purchase the Equipment.
          "Site" means https://www.mineunit.com</p>
      </div>
      <!-- end .text_section-->
      
      <div class="text_section">
        <h2>III. Pre-orders and their acceptance by the Administrator</h2>
        <p>1. Each pre-order expresses the User's intention to purchase the Equipment from the Administrator for the sum specified by the User (in accordance with the limits and the cost of a single copy of the Equipment, which are specified by the Administrator).</p>
        <p>2. Pre-orders can only be made after the User's registration on the Platform, i.e. after the User provides the Administrator with all the necessary data needed for authorization (authentication) on the Platform. If the User has specified incorrect data for any reason, he may correct them by sending an appropriate letter to the Administrator at support@mineunit.com or in his account on the Platform, before paying his pre-order.</p>
        <p>3. When pre-order's been paid, it's considered to be final, irrevocable and, accordingly, not refundable. At the same time, the Administrator executes any pre-order (i.e. sends the needed amount of prepaid equipment to the User) according to the terms and conditions specified in the Agreement.</p>
        <p>4. Also the Administrator informs the User that all the created and paid pre-orders should receive the Administrator's acceptance, and, accordingly, the Administrator, prior to sending the Equipment to the User, may reject them at any time for any reason at his discretion. </p>
        <p>5. At the same time, the Parties acknowledge that if a pre-order / several pre-orders / a part of a pre-order has been rejected by the Administrator, the User gets back the corresponding sum of money. </p>
        <p>6. The Administrator informs the User about the condition of his pre-order via the User's account or in another convenient way (via the Site, e-mail, etc.). </p>
      </div>
      <!-- end .text_section-->
      <div class="text_section">
        <h2>IV. Refunds</h2>
        <p>1. All the payments are refunded the same way they have been paid. </p>
        <p>2. If cryptocurrency payments are refunded in some national currency, they will be deducted a reasonable conversion fee. The Administrator gives a refund according to the average exchange rate at the time of this refund.</p>
        <p>3. If a bank / postal / money transfer is needed,  all the fees requested by banks and other intermediary organizations will be deducted from a refund, i.e. compensated for by the User.</p>
      </div>
      <!-- end .text_section-->
      <div class="text_section">
        <h2>V. Delivery: terms and conditions</h2>
        <p>1. Pre-orders delivery is carried out by the Administrator only upon the actual availability (production) of the Equipment. </p>
        <p>2. The expected start date of the Equipment shipping is the second quarter of 2018.</p>
        <p>3. If a pre-order delivery has been paid for, but at the time of the delivery the amount of the paid money is not sufficient for the pre-order shipping, the Administrator has the right:</p>
        <p class="subtext">3.1. Require additional payment from the User;</p>
        <p class="subtext">3.2. Give the User a pre-order refund according to the rules specified in this Agreement above.</p>
        <p>4. After the Equipment has been delivered by the Administrator and / or his authorized persons to the carrier, the ownership passes to the User.  From this point, only the carrier or the User can compensate for the loss of the Equipment, its damages or other negative effects.</p>
        <p>5. Delivery terms depend on the User's specific location, work conditions of a particular customer and other factors, that's why these terms are set directly by the carrier and the Administrator can not change them.</p>
      </div>
      <!-- end .text_section-->
      <div class="text_section">
        <h2>VI. Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>1. The Administrator provides the Equipment "as is", i.e. he can not guarantee its full working capacity after the delivery or declare some exact commercial usage characteristics as well, because it's related to the objective processes of the Equipment production and transportation, which are beyond the Administrator's control.</p>
        <p>2. While (pre)-ordering the Equipment the User also accepts that:</p>
        <p class="subtext">2.1. Different batches of the Equipment may have different work characteristics for objective reasons;</p>
        <p class="subtext">2.2. Because of mining algorithm changes, the efficiency of the Equipment may vary;</p>
        <p class="subtext">2.3. The equipment, as a complex technical device, may have certain  computing and architectural shortcomings, that are caused by physical and mathematical laws;</p>
        <p class="subtext">2.4. The Equipment application field may vary depending on the time and several other objective factors;</p>
        <p class="subtext">2.5. The administrator applies all the necessary and reasonable efforts for the stable and safe operation of the Equipment, but at the same time the stability and safety also depend on the Equipment operating conditions, the conditions of its transportation and production, therefore the Administrator can not guarantee the stability and safety of the Equipment taking into account these very factors.</p>
        <p>3. Any reconfiguration (flashing) of the Equipment may lead to its malfunctioning, therefore all the Administrator's warranties and corresponding obligations are considered to be canceled, because in this case only the User by himself can determine the further purpose and work functions of the Equipment.</p>
        <p>4. The Administrator is not responsible for any direct, indirect, incidental or special damages arising in connection with the Equipment pre-order.</p>
        <p>5. The User understands that any damages incurred to the Administrator / Platform are compensated for by the User, as the Equipment is neither intended for illegal use nor to harm the Administrator / Platform (i.e. business reputation damages, indirect losses or lost profits) </p>
        <p>6. The User bears all the risks associated with the customs clearance of the Equipment and the legality of its use in his country.</p>
      </div>
      <!-- end .text_section-->
      
      <div class="text_section">
        <h2>V. Dispute resolution</h2>
        <p>1. Any disputes shall be resolved by negotiations of the Parties.</p>
        <p>2. The disputes that cannot be resolved through negotiations can be submitted to the arbitration court at the location of the Administrator.</p>
        <p>3. The Parties also acknowledge that in an event of force majeure (i.e.  any unpredictable events, that do not depend on the will of the Parties and make the fulfilling of the contractual obligations impossible), they are not responsible for any obligations arising from this Agreement. </p>
      </div>
      <!-- end .text_section-->
      <div class="text_section">
        <h2>VI. The acceptance of the Agreement and other conditions</h2>
        <p>1. When the User puts a tick in the checkbox on the Site before the payment, that means his acceptance of all the terms of the Agreement. </p>
        <p>2. Prior to acceptance, the User agrees to read and understand the terms of the Agreement in full: the use of a personal account, registration, initiation of pre-orders also means the User's acceptance of the Agreement.</p>
        <p>3. The Administrator has the right to make any changes to the Agreement at any time, notifying the User in any way convenient for the Administrator. </p>
