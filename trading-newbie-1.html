                                <p>What can you do with 10 bucks? Get a decent coffee? Sure. But you can also kickstart an amazing career in altcoin trading. Learn about the essential elements of the trade and master a few handy techniques I wish I knew as a beginner. So, what will it be?</p>

                                <h2 id="text1"><span>Money &lt; crypto money?</span></h2>
                                <p><span>Money was there alongside men at the cradle of humanity. One might even say that it’s what made our world circle around an orbit, that orbit being the motivation of gaining more value. Money (or the concept of it) has formed us as a species as much as basic instincts like survival or reproduction.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Take a look at how ancient tribes of our ancestors functioned back in the day: hunters gathered meat, gatherers picked herbs and berries, while there were also those who took care of the fire and made sure it was never put down because the only ones capable of cherishing it back from the ambers were the lightning gods from the sky.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Everyone in a group had a purpose and all were fed and taken care of because everyone pitched in. That’s how trade was born, although it used skills or services instead of goods.</span></p>

                                <p><span>The concept of trade was fine and dandy until mankind evolved even further through the invention of craft and tools.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Fast forward time a bit and enter the cabin of a blacksmith. He is making horse hooves and shovels and pickaxes and whatnot. Every farmer needs those, right? But none of them can trade their service or the results of their work any longer as all of them have but grain to offer and there are only so many sacks a blacksmith needs to provide for himself.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Even if grain was a worthy currency, how many sacks of grain is a pickaxe worth? You don’t know? Well, neither did the blacksmith. Thus the concept of valuables was born as further empowering the craftsman to choose what he likes or dislikes to receive for his services.</span></p>

                                <p><span>The concept of valuables is simple: if there’s little of something in the world, or that something is hard to come by, that thing is valuable. Hence we started using gold as the first currency.</span></p>
                                <p><span>The thing is, gold is a bit too hard to get one’s hands on while copper or bronze are easier. Welcome the world's first currency exchange rate done for the convenience of the people and a solid concept for money that can be measured, stored, and magnified.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Yes, people figured out money for what it is (a store of wealth and a common unit of transactions) ages ago and only moved towards more convenience ever since. Or so they say...</span></p>

                                <p><span>In reality, we still fail to create a fitting concept for wealth exchange because money sucks at its job. Here’s why:</span></p>

                                <p><span>Gold and jewels don’t work. They are only fine and dandy in countries with mines, but if your neighbor’s soils are not as rich as yours, brace yourself for a war. Plus it is hard to make coins, spread them across the population and expect a growing economy.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Paper money backed by gold: The governments have created special contracts with people in the form of paper. Those contracts are worth a set amount of gold stored in a treasury. They are easily carryable and rather flexible. That’s why we’ve been using paper money ever since the bronze age. The paper money concept works great. On paper. That noted, a government may only print as much money as they are worth in gold.</span></p>

                                <p><span>But why limit yourself? Why not print more paper and sell it as nuggets?</span></p>

                                <p><span>So thought the German government in the late 1920s, and look what that idea led to.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Inflation aside, gold-backed paper still benefits the countries with more mines while in a world we live in today gold isn't worth as much as it used to be. Innovation and technology are the new virtues that affect the value of traditional currencies even further.</span></p>
                                <p><span>It is also risky to store capital in paper money as such a capital may lose its worth overnight, meaning that paper money does not deliver on one of two features it is designed to deliver on.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Ok, now that we realize the conceptual errors of relying on traditional currencies we are to understand that there are still countless custom issues existing, such as fraud, theft, forgery, and a goddamned fee on any transaction you try to make as the government always wants a slice of your pie.</span></p>

                                <p><span>These are the core reasons why humanity never stopped at the achieved and kept inventing new, better means to store and spend one’s fortune.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Hence cryptocurrencies were born.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Are crypto coins the perfect solution for everyone wishing to trade, invest or store capital? No, they are not.</span></p>

                                <p><span>But are they better than fiat money? Yes, they are in a lot of cases. The likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum do not solve everything that’s wrong with the conceptual errors of cash, but they do a much better job of solving the custom ones like fraud, forgery, inconvenience or unreasonable fees charged for nothing.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Here is how they do it:</span></p>

                                <p><strong>Cryptocurrencies are decentralized</strong><span>. There are no regulatory authorities in the form of banks or governments. The entire network works on a peer-to-peer basis.</span></p>

                                <p><strong>They are created by computers</strong><span>. We do not need gold or state law to back cryptocurrencies. They are generated with one of the largest values modern world has to offer - technology. Or, in simpler words, cryptocurrencies experience growth in value through delivering value to others.</span></p>

                                <p><strong>There is a cap or a maximum limit</strong><span>. A lot of cryptocurrencies have market caps, which means that there are only so few coins we are allowed to mine. The lack of supply works as a rise in demand, hence it works in your favor.</span></p>
                                <p><span>There are no authorities that can print as many coins as they feel like, thus preventing inflation.</span></p>

                                <p><strong>Transactions are <span class="inline-comment-marker valid" data-ref="3ae9ef2c-8c61-406b-9939-928427ae8fd6">encrypted</span></strong><span><span class="inline-comment-marker valid" data-ref="3ae9ef2c-8c61-406b-9939-928427ae8fd6">.</span> Both the sender and the recipient of any transaction is protected through encryption. No one knows how much money you have or where you got it from. The funny thing is: everyone in the network knows about the amount of coin in the wallet. They just don't know that the wallet is yours.</span>
                                </p>

                                <p><strong>Transactions are secure</strong><span>. The transaction itself, while publicly available in the network as an operation, is also encrypted and verified by the network. If money is sent from point A to point B, there is no other destination for it to land on. Theft does not exist unless your wallet is stolen.</span></p>

                                <p><strong>There are no hidden fees</strong><span>. What more can we say? There are no hidden fees. Period. Do note that "no hidden fees" does not mean "no fees at all". There are transactions fees that are volatile and completely dependent on the network load. But more on that later.</span></p>

                                <h2 id="text2"><span>Forex trading &lt; crypto trading?</span></h2>

                                <p><span>As of now, Forex is one of the largest markets in the world and it rarely sees any competition. Its size is a staple of depth, stability, and liquidity.</span></p>

                                <p><span>The average Forex turnaround is $5 Trillion annually. Colossal volumes of trade on such a level are achieved through advances in technologies and availability of the internet.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Crypto Trading, on the other hand, is by far a smaller niche. Let's take a look at Bitcoin trading to see the difference: even in 2017 when BTC spiked to $4K per piece, the total market cap jumped to $70 Billion. <span class="inline-comment-marker valid" data-ref="e7f7eede-64a8-484d-8e59-4e9f926a79a7">The daily turnaround rarely exceeds $5 Billion</span>.</span>
                                </p>

                                <p><span>Sounds impressive? Not if compared to Forex, where a single currency like the Swiss Franc has a daily turnaround of nearly $250 Billion.</span></p>

                                <p><span>What we have on our hands is a classic David VS Goliath story, with a few differences.</span></p>

                                <p><span>For starters, people are trading fiat currencies on Forex, and that means that they bring along all of the issues of money we’ve covered above. The market is larger and relatively safer as of now, but with cryptos you are constantly ready for change. If something big hits the Forex exchange we will be seeing a skyrocketing suicide rate shortly after.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Investments are also flowing on a different scale. You must have a fortune to make a larger fortune in Forex trading. This is not the case with the Crypto Trading market where the entry is limited by but one value - the amount you are willing to invest at the moment. Want to start with $10? Go ahead and you will make a profit. A small one, but a profit nonetheless.</span></p>

                                <h3 id="CopyofSection:Trading,Level:Newbie,Course:1-CryptoTradingBenefits"><strong>Crypto Trading Benefits</strong></h3>

                                <p><strong>Volatility:</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile, meaning they change in value often. Keep an open eye and you will be able to sell high and buy low fast. A 5% ROI is a common staple, yet your earnings may exceed this benchmark by far. This is something Forex can't boast with.</span>
                                </p>

                                <p><strong>Fewer expenses:</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Yes, if you use a broker you will pay him or her a commission, but otherwise, the fee is limited if compared to other trading markets.</span>
                                </p>

                                <p><strong>Ease of entry:</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>all you need to enter the crypto trading market is a capital. Any capital, from a few million to a few bucks will do the trick just fine.</span>
                                </p>

                                <p><span><strong>Stability</strong>: This is an extremely fun thing to say about the crypto market, but digital currencies, despite their volatility, are more stable. <span class="inline-comment-marker valid" data-ref="ebd13839-60a1-48d2-b1e7-dfc24ca2dda8">Wars, disasters, rebellions, and inflation do not affect digital cash as it is not tied to a certain government’s position of strengths.</span></span>

                                <h3 id="CopyofSection:Trading,Level:Newbie,Course:1-Cryptotradingisnotawalkinthepark"><strong>Crypto trading is not a walk in the park</strong></h3>

                                <p><span>Don’t get this wrong: Crypto trading has a simpler entry point and can provide you with a larger ROI than traditional trading, but it is still not perfect.</span></p>

                                <p><span>You will need to buy entry currencies like BTC to start trading. You will not be able to go for other, cheaper Altcoins as they can be only be purchased with other Altcoins.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Cryptocurrencies are tech-based and everything that has code in it also has bugs in it. No one is ensured from costly glitches.</span></p>

                                <h2 id="text3"><span>How to pick a crypto wallet?</span></h2>

                                <p><span>Generally speaking, there are two types of wallets fit for storing cryptocurrencies: hot and cold ones.</span></p>

                                <p><span>If you’ve gone through our previous courses you already know the difference, but for the sake of those who’ve just tuned in, we will cover the differences briefly.</span></p>

                                <p><span>A hot wallet is connected to the internet. It is 100% digital and comes in the form of a web or a mobile app. Internet connectivity is both a strength and a weakness in our case as this is the wallet you will be using for trading but, at the same time, everything (like EVERYTHING) that is connected to the internet nowadays is as good as compromised from the box.</span></p>

                                <p><span>A cold wallet is a physical device that is not connected to the internet like, say, a flash drive. It lacks the flexibility of hot wallet, but the only way money can be stolen from it is if the thieves will physically get their hands on your device. This is rather unlikely, don’t you say?</span></p>

                                <p><span>We recommend you have both options available. Use the coin from the hot one for trading and use the cold one for storing what you’ve earned. Also note that the coin you choose to trade will be taken away from your wallet into the exchange platform's system until the trade is done.</span></p>

                                <h2 id="CopyofSection:Trading,Level:Newbie,Course:1-Howdowalletswork?"><span>How do wallets work?</span></h2>

                                <p><span>A wallet is but a specific string of characters that form your unique private key. The programming aspect of the wallet helps you send and receive a transaction from and to that string of characters. Think of the key as a map of coordinates to where your coins are hidden. He, who wields the map is as good in rights as he, who wields the wallet.</span></p>

                                <p><span>It takes a long time for a wallet to process such a long string of characters, hence they use a little hack called a <span class="inline-comment-marker valid" data-ref="8b659470-292d-4872-beca-060741574314">"seed phrase"</span>. A <span class="inline-comment-marker valid" data-ref="9564b9df-9ec5-4855-80fd-6324a1d4d60e">seed phrase</span> is a set of 12 to 24 <span class="inline-comment-marker valid" data-ref="22d76255-7e68-4aaa-8956-dbc2de5c7473">random words</span> that were chosen from the 2048 words from the Bitcoin's BIP-39 standard. It works exactly like a private key. It seems simpler on paper, but random characters of random words are as hard for a hacker to crack as the Private Key.</span>
                                </p>

                                <p><span>Example:<span>&nbsp;</span></span><em><span><span class="inline-comment-marker valid" data-ref="69a3ad4d-ffa9-4717-aa4b-bc26c9f3ac96">aerobic affair bar netter blame canal cat distance door income lady lense motor off offer</span></span></em></p>

                                <p><span>Do note that given <span class="inline-comment-marker valid" data-ref="95ec64a1-f06b-45cb-984e-ea24081d3728">seed phrases</span> work just like the private key meaning if someone knows your phrase that someone knows the key.</span>
                                </p>

                                <p><span>Yes, a wallet is really is as simple as that. In fact, a paper wallet is one of the more popular cold wallets. A paper wallet is a piece of paper where you write the private key down. Of course, there is the downside of losing said sheet of paper, but when it comes to the technology behind the wallets, a key address is about it.</span></p>

                                <h2 id="CopyofSection:Trading,Level:Newbie,Course:1-Howtopickacoldwallet?"><span>How to pick a cold wallet?</span></h2>

                                <p><span>Hardware wallets are the most popular form of cold wallet out there. They are a device that, when connected to the computer, operates like a hot wallet, but is kept in offline mode once unplugged.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Picking a hardware wallet is relatively easy. Look at the brand just like you would when purchasing any other hardware like a PC or a Mobile Phone. You know the difference between an iPhone and a no-name Chinese fake, don’t you? Same applieshere.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Some of the better brands on the market are Trezor, KeepKey and Ledger Nano S. Trezor models are some of the more user-friendly ones as they come with a handy OLED screen from the box but, in reality, any of the ones named above will do the trick.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Do note that hardware wallets come at a price. They are, after all, a physical device that requires manufacturing.</span></p>

                                <h2 id="CopyofSection:Trading,Level:Newbie,Course:1-Howtopickahotwallet?"><span>How to pick a hot wallet?</span></h2>

                                <p><span>Ok, guys, this is where the fun starts. The internet is overcrowded with scams and frauds when it comes to hot crypto wallets, hence there are quite a few things you should keep an open eye on.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Is the wallet using an HTTP or HTTPS protocol? Because the latter is the only secure one. Finding out which one is used in any given wallet is easy - just look at the address bar in your browser. If the site starts with https:// than the “s” in it stands for security.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Then you are to check out the login screens. Do they look solid to you? In order to be valid, they must have a 2FA or a two-factor authentication like a captcha request with the code sent to your phone or email after you submit the login and password.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Then there is the multisig option. Multisig requires more than one key for authorization of any given Bitcoin transaction. Think of two men holding the keys to the nuclear button and they have to turn the keys together at the same time for the whole thing to work. That’s the physical equivalent of multisig.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Also, just like with hardware, there is the brand aspect. Pay close attention to the brand of the wallet and the way its pure name is maintained by the company.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Talk with support via email or live chat. The way support agents answer your questions (or whether they answer anything at all) is a great indicator.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Lastly, there is the Internet at your disposal. Pick a wallet to your liking and google for reviews, customer feedback, and comments on various forums like the Reddit. This is one of the best ways to find out what real people think of any given wallet and their experience might drastically change your decision.</span></p>

                                <h2 id="CopyofSection:Trading,Level:Newbie,Course:1-Thefinaltipforchoosingawallet"><span>The final tip for choosing a wallet</span></h2>

                                <p><span>Never put all of your eggs in one basket. Cold wallets are used for storing and hot are used for trading, but that doesn't mean you are limited to one of each. Having a private key both on a hardware device and in an excel sheet has never harmed anyone. Same can be said for hot wallets: multiple accounts with “spare change” on them don't hurt as bad when lost.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Now that we know how and where to store money it’s time for some trading. Start with opening a brokerage account.</span></p>

                                <h2 id="text4"><span>How to start trading?</span></h2>

                                <p><span>Not to sound like an ad but we can't really recommend a platform that is better than Coinbase. The best part about Coinbase is that it meets all the legal regulations of trading in the countries it operates. Coinbase is the definition of squeaky clean and that’s a hell of a plus in the digital cryptoworld.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Coinbase offers a wallet from which you can buy, sell, and exchange cryptocurrencies, and it has the GDAX or the Global Digital Assets Exchange.</span></p>

                                <p><span>If Coinbase is unavailable in your country or you don’t feel like using it for whatever reasons you are more than welcome to look for alternatives. The process is rather similar to the one mentioned above: search for social proof, brand validity, login security, decent support, and anonymity in a trading platform.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Now that you have both the wallet and the trading platform accounts - fund them. It shouldn't be that hard: use your credit card to buy some Bitcoin. $10 should give you a nice feel of how everything works without forcing you to overspend.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Play around with Coinbase, get the feel of how the money flows in the system and proceed further to GDAX. This is a more sophisticated platform by Coinbase and you can use the same login but the functionality is vastly different.</span></p>

                                <p><span>For starters, GDAX offers smaller fees: 0.1% to 0.25% for buyers of the crypto-coin and 0% for sellers. The platform also comes with a mobile app for you to trade on the go. In an extremely volatile environment of crypto trading, this is a benefit only a fool will neglect.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Ok, now that we are all set up the time has come to make your first trade. Or has it?</span></p>

                                <h2 id="text5"><span>The art of a smart investment</span></h2>

                                <h3 id="CopyofSection:Trading,Level:Newbie,Course:1-Stage1"><strong>Stage 1</strong></h3>

                                <p><span>Before you are to proceed into the world of trading there are still a few essentials you have to master. For starters, you are to figure out how blockchain, mining and trading work in the first place. We have a free course and a free eBook on these subjects, so this stage shouldn't be that hard.</span></p>

                                <p><span>You can find the course here and the book here.</span></p>

                                <h3 id="CopyofSection:Trading,Level:Newbie,Course:1-Stage2"><strong>Stage 2</strong></h3>

                                <p><span>Stage two would be to learn about all the different kinds of cryptocurrencies. As of now, you have $10 worth of Bitcoin and that’s not a lot.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Sure BTC makes the half of all the crypto market currencies, but there is also another half you shouldn't miss out on. There are at least 100+ currencies where the coin is worth $1 (give or take a few dimes) and having 10 of those coins beats having 0.00023 or something of Bitcoin.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Why is this important? Given that Bitcoin is remaining somewhat of a constant after last year’s spikes in prices, other currencies can grow unexpectedly. Your $10 worth of IOTA, for example, might become $20 in a couple of days or even hours. Then, after trading IOTA back for Bitcoin you will have twice as much money. And if you were to stick with Bitcoin alone you would have had the same amount of crypto ($10) give or take a few dimes.</span></p>

                                <p><span>This, dear friends, is how trading really works in the crypto world, but to get it completely, you must understand the currencies.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Top cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin</span></p>

                                <p><span>Here are a few examples of the most prominent cryptocurrencies to date. Do note that these are not everything exchange has to offer, but merely the hottest ones at the moment this course was created.</span></p>

                                <p><span>- Litecoin (LTC)</span></p>
                                <p><span>- Ethereum (ETC)</span></p>
                                <p><span>- Zcash (ZEC)</span></p>
                                <p><span>- Dash</span></p>
                                <p><span>- Ripple (XRP)</span></p>
                                <p><span>- Monero (XMR)</span></p>
                                <h3 id="CopyofSection:Trading,Level:Newbie,Course:1-Stage3"><strong>Stage 3</strong></h3>

                                <p><span>Trading is risky. You are to understand this fact before you proceed further. Cryptocurrencies are by far more volatile than any other asset in the world. This is a part of their charm as a fortune may be made overnight, but it is also a massive drawback as that fortune may be lost as easily.</span></p>

                                <p><span>The math is simple: the higher the reward, the higher the risk. Sit on this thought for a bit.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Here is an example: Bitcoin was worth both $2.983 and $1.992 in June of 2017. That’s a 30% decrease in value over just a few weeks! A few months have changed the game entirely as Bitcoin skyrocketed to $4.764 per coin in September. Then a new game changer emerged in the face of China - their ban of ICO-related fundraising has led to a 12% drop in Bitcoin Trading, 23% drop in Ether trading and a whopping 32% drop in Litecoin trading.</span></p>

                                <p><span>It’s bumps like these that you should watch out for as they prove once and for all that you should never invest more in a trade than you are willing to lose.</span></p>

                                <h3 id="CopyofSection:Trading,Level:Newbie,Course:1-Stage4"><strong>Stage 4</strong></h3>

                                <p><span>Do your homework! No, seriously, this course is a nice headstart, but if you take your finger off the pulse of the market - if even for the day - you will lose your competitive advantage.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Reading and studying is as integral to a flourishing trading career as coin exchange (if not more).</span></p>

                                <p><span>We recommend you to join the Mineunit Club, a place where crypto enthusiasts exchange thoughts, opinions, and ideas on a daily basis and their efforts are accompanied by the guest-stars of the crypto gurus from all over the world.</span></p>

                                <p><span>That noted, we are also not the epiphany of the crypto market and you are to read social media news on Twitter and Reddit, follow such blogs as Business Insider, NYT, The Wall Street Journal, Brave New Coin, Crypto Insider, Bitcoin Talk and others.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Make a habit of checking out all these publications on a daily basis. Turn on the notifications on your phone and keep your finger on the pulse of everything going on right now in real time.</span></p>

                                <p><span>In an environment as volatile as the crypto market, this is the only way for you to buy low and sell high in time.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Please remember that even if you miss out on something the other players will not, so don't give them the chance to outplay you.</span></p>

                                <h3 id="CopyofSection:Trading,Level:Newbie,Course:1-Stage5"><strong>Stage 5</strong></h3>

                                <p><span>Do more homework. Your goal, as with any other form of trading, is to buy low and sell high. For that you must understand what is low now and what will be high later on. The only way to do this right is through analysis.</span></p>

                                <h2 id="CopyofSection:Trading,Level:Newbie,Course:1-Thedon’ts"><span>The don’ts</span></h2>

                                <p><span>Never confuse judgment with emotion. If your assets start falling, you have to decide whether to sell them now and not lose more or to wait for them to come back at price. This is a task for analysis, not rapid “crowd mentality” decision-making.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Never trade too often. A few times per week should do the trick. If you sell too soon you risk losing potential profit.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Never run out of patience. Trading is not a gamble, and quick thinking, while beneficial to a degree, may do more harm than good in the long run.</span></p>

                                <p><span>There is only one thing you are to do - base decisions on analysis. One of the best ways of doing so lies in the art of understanding the charts.</span></p>

                                <p><span>GDAX has a fine variety of charts for you to analyze and make smart, data-driven decisions:</span></p>

                                <p><strong>The Price Chart:</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>The one chart above all this one shows the history of trading over a lasting period of time. You can see how the prices rose and fell just to rise and fall again over a lasting period of time. This chart is an amazing tool for predicting if a currency will skyrocket like it did a month, two months, three months ago and so forth.</span>
                                </p>

                                <p><strong>The Depth Chart:</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>This is the chart that shows the difference between what the sellers want for their coin and what the buyers are willing to give for it. This is a great tool for seeing what people are actually buying and selling the coin for and how close the demand is to supply.</span>
                                </p>

                                <p><strong>The Order Book</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>shows the entirety of the orders in the Coinbase system. You can learn about the market size, price and order size for each order placed in the network.</span>
                                </p>

                                <p><span>Oh, and please remember the most important chart of them all - the chart that can be applied to any trading ever done by men.</span></p>

                                <h2 id="text6"><span>A trading strategy you can start with right now!</span></h2>

                                <p><span>Ok, the time has finally come to talk strategy. Blow the dust off that $10 of yours you have in your wallet and start making money. Here’s how you do it!</span></p>

                                <p><span>What is the Best Bitcoin trading strategy for beginners? The one that’s based on price over the art of trading itself. We will be covering a few more complex strategies later on, but, for now the one that’s 85% price game should do the trick.</span></p>

                                <p><span>For starters, we will need benchmarks. In our case, one should do the trick, that benchmark being the OBV or the On Balance Volume of BTC (or Ethereum if you feel like it).</span></p>

                                <p><span>Note that we are talking about the fast “daily” trading now and OBV will indicate the amount of money that went either in or out of the market.</span></p>

                                <p><span>This works as follows: if the BTC price is climbing up and the OBV is going down that people are selling. Same goes for the opposite.</span></p>

                                <p><span>You, however, are not looking for the difference in the stats. Your goal is to notice when both the OBV and the Bitcoin price are going in the same direction.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Now that that’s covered we are to proceed to step 1 of our trading guide:</span></p>

                                <h3 id="CopyofSection:Trading,Level:Newbie,Course:1-Step1"><strong>Step 1</strong></h3>

                                <p><span>Compare Bitcoin and Ethereum with the OBV. All three of them should look somewhat alike or at least follow the same pattern.</span></p>

                                <h3 id="CopyofSection:Trading,Level:Newbie,Course:1-Step2"><strong>Step 2</strong></h3>

                                <p><span>Check out the price difference. If there is a sudden spike in either BTC or Ethereum while the same is absent on the chart for the other currency - congrats, you’ve got your golden ticket.</span></p>

                                <p><span>If there is a sudden spike in both the Bitcoin and OBV, but not in Ethereum, the reality is that Ethereum will catch up to the trend, meaning its price will grow. Buy the coin now and sell right after the spike hits the sweet spot and you have yourself some profit.</span></p>

                                <p><span>This is the simplest, yet one of the most profitable ways of trade that exists in the crypto world right now. Use it to buy and reverse-engineer it to sell, and voila - you’ve got yourself a working strategy.</span></p>

                                <p>The creative process isn't just "generating ideas." The reality is it's a five-step process, and ideation is only one of those steps. The entire creative process is made up of objective finding, data gathering, problem design, ideation, and selection. Understanding the role of each step enables us to ensure that we generate the most effective solutions. In this course, Stefan Mumaw guides us through the five steps and then shows us what the complete process looks like, with a real-world project: designing a website.</p>
