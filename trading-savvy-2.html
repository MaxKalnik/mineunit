                                <p><span>Why? Because timing is everything to a trader. This happens because we predict the buy low sell high ratio based on data. Data is usually visualised in charts and charts, in turn, may get tricky.</span></p>

                                <p><span>This is the direction Bitcoin was headed for the duration of a couple of months. Should we all proceed back on board the ship then?</span></p>

                                <p><span>That noted, there are also hourly and by the minute charts available for traders. Those bad boys look even more dramatic and take some adjustment for the brain to process them accordingly.</span></p>

                                <p><span>These charts display what’s the greatest weakness and the most charming beauty of crypto trading - market volatility juiced up to the max.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Why is volatility both a strength and a weakness? Because a smart trader may earn a fortune in moments and a less fortunate one may lose it even faster. And, given you are willing to become a smart trader, you will have to master the art of looking at the appropriate charts at the best available time for you.</span></p>

                                <p><span>What are your options?</span></p>

                                <p><strong>Bitcoin scalpers</strong></p>

                                <p><span>Usually referred to as those who pick up pennies in from off the steamroller, scalpers are traders who specialize in quick, swift and precise trades. Scalpers monitor the crypto market every moment, and five-minute tick charts are their weapon of choice. &nbsp;</span></p>

                                <p><span>Their work is based on small iterations in a currencies worth that happens every so often. Scalpers may make hundreds of trades per day and their motto is a penny saves the dollar.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Quick cash grabs in microscopic amounts make up quite the sum by the end of the day, and given the frequency of the trades, their win to loss ratio is probably the highest.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Scalping is fast-paced. This is both a benefit, especially for beginner traders who do not possess the funds to trade big and wish to make a profit fast, but it is also a downside - scalpers never make a fortune. They just don't have the time to earn it with all the trades they are doing.</span></p>

                                <p><strong>Day traders</strong></p>

                                <p><span>Day traders work in a similar fashion to scalpers with a slight difference in timing. We are talking about several trades per day that operate by the same principles, yet are aimed at a higher profit through a higher difference in exchange rates.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Day traders usually follow half an hour, hourly or two-hour charts.</span></p>

                                <p><span>The term day traders came from original stock exchange traders who tend to close all of their deals by the end of the day. The same is true with crypto traders following this pattern.</span></p>

                                <p><strong>Swing traders</strong></p>

                                <p><span>Coins tend to go in cycles or the so-called swings. The price is dropping for a while on one side and rising for a while on the other. Swing traders choose to input more patience into their activities and only sell or buy when a long-term opportunity arises.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Swing traders follow daily and weekly charts to make educated decisions based on the patterns in currency price they’ve discovered.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Swing trading is probably the most profitable short-term trading practice, yet it comes with the highest risks of betting on the wrong horse.</span></p>

                                <p><em><span>Pro tip: you, as a trader, are not limited to just one practice. Use all three at the same time and gain the benefits of all!</span></em></p>

                                <p><span>So, scalping, huh? This is one of the most popular trading practices in the world of crypto for a series of reasons, but the primary two are the ease of entrance and the speed of first profits.</span></p>

                                <p><span>We believe that scalping is the best way for beginner traders to sink their toes into the deep waters of crypto trading, yet it is not a sustainable methodology in the long run. Think about it, how many trades can you make per day? Ten? Twenty? A hundred?</span></p>

                                <p><span>Ok, that may very well be the case, but for how long will you be able to keep up at the same pace? You’ll burn out in a month or two and, given the ROI is there, but as the trades themselves it is minimal. You will be left without appropriate motivation if you make 10-30 bucks per day and use it as a limit.</span></p>

                                <p><span>That noted, scalping also requires you to trade on specific platforms with near-zero fees on transactions, and a lot of such platforms may be either fraud or clickbait.</span></p>

                                <p><span>That’s why we suggest you take a look at the advantages and disadvantages of scalping a bit closer.</span></p>

                                <p><strong>The pros:</strong></p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><span>A lot of opportunities for both selling and buying are available 24/7. The market of cryptocurrencies is extremely volatile, hence there is enough room for you to trade nonstop at your own pace.</span></li>
                                    <li><span>Short-term trades are simpler, more predictable. How much can change in a minute or two, really?</span></li>
                                    <li><span>Risk mitigation opens the doors to long-term profitability. Your win to loss ratio will be sky-high.</span></li>

                                    <li><span>You have access to multiple markets and more time to focus on each of them as you monitor their state in real time.</span></li>

                                    <li><span>You must have a detailed plan and stick with it at all times, thus butchering the otherwise flexible art of trading.</span></li>
                                    <li><span>You don't see the bigger picture.</span></li>

                                    <li><span>You will have to work harder and longer in order to build up a worthwhile portfolio.</span></li>
                                    <li><span>And, lastly, you will spend a lot of time behind a screen, which is bad for your eyes and your back.</span></li>

                                <p><span>Day trading is similar to scalping but both the stakes and the gains are higher. You will still require a platform with minimal fees, and the required investment is not as high as with other types of trading, but you have more time at your disposal to perform analysis.</span></p>

                                    <li><span>The potential to make a worthwhile profit while keeping the risks at bay.</span></li>
                                    <li><span>The ability to make data-driven decisions instead of operating on hunches.</span></li>
                                    <li><span>The trades are still safe and predictable enough (if that can be said about trading at all).</span></li>
                                    <li><span>The access to multiple markets is still present, just like with scalp trades.</span></li>
                                    <li><span>Win to loss ratio isn't as sunny as with scalping, but the wins count for more money, hence there is still room for planned long-term profitability.</span></li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>The cons:</strong></p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><span>Day trading is a full-time job, meaning it will become your only source of profit.</span></li>
                                    <li><span>The competition is high as you have to fight against both corporate level players who invest millions for a market advantage and scalp traders who currently dominate the crypto trading niche by numbers.</span></li>
                                    <li><span>You will be behind the screen all day, just like with scalp trading.</span></li>
                                    <li><span>There is no consistent pay. Traders do not know the word consistency but, very much like gamblers, rely heavily on that large win over the horizon at all times.</span></li>

                                <p><span>Swing trading is a trading methodology that is based heavily on longer intervals between trade operations. You are to both buy and sell smartly and there is little room for error.</span></p>

                                </p>

                                <p><span>Swing trading also requires a significantly higher starting capital. Investments of over a thousand dollars are required to make decent profits in the long run.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Swing trading requires an additional level of education from traders as well and is generally associated with more professional players. With all honesty, we state that this course will not make you a professional swing trader nor will any other one course on the internet. You will have to invest a lot of time and effort into learning if you wish to succeed.</span></p>

                                <p><strong>The pros:</strong></p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><span>Swing trading is not a full-time job. You will have enough time to both trade and study while maintaining your regular way of life.</span></li>
                                    <li><span>Swing trading is more strategic. Trades are done over a long period of time, leaving you with enough data to analyze the market and predict the best possible next move.</span></li>
                                    <li><span>Your losses are still smaller than the ones of long-term traders.</span></li>
                                    <li><span>Your gains are by far larger than the gains of other short-term traders.</span></li>
                                    <li><span>The rules are set for you. Swing trading relies heavily on data and analysis and those two bad boys usually leave little room for maneuver. Knowing the rules of the game is the halfway milestone towards winning it.</span></li>

                                <p><span>We have briefly touched upon the subjects of technical and fundamental analysis in the chapter above, but what are those things, really?</span></p>

                                <p><strong>Fundamental analysis</strong><span>, if put simply, is the art of looking at the bigger picture. In our case, you will have to thoroughly analyze the niche as well as the currency you are interested in. This type of analysis requires an understanding of the blockchain technology as a whole as well as technical developments, news, and trends regarding Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin or any other currency.</span></p>

                                <p><span>For instance, there was an event when China’s government took on the battle against cryptocurrencies. They have forbidden their banks and companies from investing in ICO, and this event has greatly damaged the crypto niche as a whole.</span></p>

                                <p><span><span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="152bfd68-0e60-4d03-832d-db7bcd6e9dbb">Fundamental analysis is a way of looking at the technology behind the cryptocurrency over its current worth. If the technology seems efficient, and the price is not too high now, then you are to buy the coins in the hopes that other players will also notice the value of tech over the price of the coin.</span></span>
                                </p>

                                <p><strong>Technical analysis</strong><span>, on the other hand, is all about predicting the price of the coin in the near future. This type of analysis is preferable for a short-term trader for obvious reasons.</span></p>

                                <p><span><span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="6f4491de-54cb-42f1-b168-9bf5e5a574d4">Technical analysis is based on market statistics like trading volumes and price movement. The goal of this analysis lies in identifying the patterns coins will surely follow in the near future.</span></span>
                                </p>

                                <p>Indicators also play a large role in the technical analysis. They are your best friend when you are trying to pinpoint a pattern. There are two types of indicators: leading and lagging. The first is used to predict the future of price movements based on the existing state of events and the latter is more of a confirmation tool that focused on the present.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                                <p><span>“Regardless of what happens in the world, the price speaks for itself”, is the motto. &nbsp;</span></p>

                                <h2 id="Section:Trading;Level:Savvy;Course:2(Copy)-Typesoforders"><span>Types of orders</span></h2>

                                <p><span>Every crypto market has an order book. This is the place where all of the orders are shown, as well as the order history.</span></p>

                                <p><span>An order is a purchase or the sale of any given cryptocurrency. Buy orders are called bids and sell orders are called asks. Why? Because in the first case people are bidding on the prices and in the second people are asking for a certain amount of value in exchange for a coin.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Orders are the foundation of the current cryptocurrency price. The price of Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum or any other coin is the price of the very last trade conducted in the exchange.</span></p>

                                <p><span>This happens because cryptocurrencies have no central regulating authority, hence the network gets to decide on the price of the coin.</span></p>

                                <p><span>When traders talk high and low they refer to the highest and lowest prices of the coin. That noted, the term refers to the prices in the last 24 hours over the historical maximum or minimum.</span></p>

                                <p><span>The overall volume of orders, both bids and asks <span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="a9f9228a-23ed-4e42-8fe4-5989d8cc0b52">is</span> an important metric as well. It is also calculated within a certain timeframe and the volume is the main factor you are to pay attention to when analyzing a trend. &nbsp;</span>
                                </p>

                                <p><span>A healthy trend of growth has a smooth circular transition between large volumes ( a rise in prices) and low volumes (a drop in prices). Sudden shifts in volumes may indicate a reversing trend, hence require additional attention.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Aside from all of the above, there are also specific types of orders you must be aware of if you wish to succeed in trading. All of them are similar in name but the devil is in the details. &nbsp;</span></p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><span>A limit order: This is the type of order when you set a fixed price to buy or sell coins. You might get fewer coins with this order if the price grows. Here’s an example. Let’s say that Bitcoin is worth $2K per piece and you set that precise price for it looking to purchase 10 coins. If there are only 8 coins on the market available for $2K and the rest are being sold for $2.1K you will get 8 coins. Your order for the remaining two will remain live and valid until someone agrees to sell you coin for $2K.</span></li>
                                    <li><span>A market order: This type of order is placed when you wish to purchase coin at the current market price. If you set a cheap price you will have to wait until the market accumulates enough sellers to provide for your order. That noted, you never stop buying Bitcoin until the order is complete. This may result in you purchasing a lot of coins at different prices.</span></li>
                                    <li><span>A stop-loss order. Stop-loss orders are your safety measures. You can set up a price and if the market drops your coins will be sold automatically.</span></li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><span>Real world short-term trading is as much about not overspending on fees as it is about making a profit. The markets themselves encourage trade through reduction of fees if certain conditions are met.</span></p>

                                <p><span>This knowledge might save you thousands of dollars in the long run, hence it will open the price game section of this course.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Become a market maker as often as possible. A market maker is a person that opens new trades that are not otherwise seen on the market.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Here is an example: if the lowest seller is offering Bitcoin for $2K a piece, then selling the same coin for $1.9K a piece will make you a market maker.</span></p>

                                <p><span>The person who will be buying these coins from you at a cheaper rate will be the market taker. The taker is charged with higher fees while you are either not charged at all or charged a significantly smaller fee as you are the one to open new opportunities for all. &nbsp;</span></p>

                                <p><span>Going a dime less while selling might save you much more in the long run!</span></p>

                                            <p><span>The Japanese Candlesticks (AKA the OHLC) are a fine method for illustrating the highest, lowest, opening and closing prices over a certain period of time. The candles come in two colors, red and green. The green candle indicates that the closing price was higher than the opening and the red one indicates the opposite. &nbsp;</span></p>

                                            <p><span>This is one of the simplest, yet most effective charts that can be used in technical analysis. These candles are the bread and butter of short-term traders.</span></p>

                                            <p><span>If a market is filled with green candles, it means that the prices are growing. Such a market is called the bull market.</span></p>

                                            <p><span>If a market is filled with red candles, it means that the prices are going down. Such a market is called the bear market.</span></p>

                                            <p><span>The two go on in circles, which indicates a healthy market pattern. The shorter the time span you check for these candles, the higher the chances you’ll stumble upon a growing or a fading market, and that is when you strike (buy or sell).</span></p>

                                            <p><strong>The pivot reversal strategy</strong></p>

                                            <p><span>Some of the best tactics of trading are based on specific indicators or benchmarks. The Pivot Reversal strategy is a great practice that provides traders with a clear way of understanding how the prices work and it shows if the market belongs to the “bulls” or the “bears”.</span></p>

                                            <p><span>So what is a pivot point?</span></p>

                                            <p><span>A pivot point is the point of rotation. This is where the market turns either up or down in price. The pivot point is calculated with the high, low and closing prices of a previous period of time whether it is a day, an hour, or five minutes.</span></p>

                                            <p><span>The math works as follows: the clear pivot point is the sum of high, low, and closing price divided by three.</span></p>

                                            <p><span>Your goal is to calculate the pivot point based on a daily chart and then apply it on a smaller chart, like an hourly one. This way you will see how the market moves on a larger scale than the scale of your trade. Why bother? Because this is one of the safest ways of predicting trends.</span></p>

                                            <p><span>The odds are that the behavior of the market on a daily basis will mirror the behavior of the market on an hourly basis or, in simpler words, the curves on both charts will be more or less the same.</span></p>

                                            <p><span>Why is this useful? Because you can predict the short-term future based on the bigger picture. For example, if prices traded below the central pivot for most of the session and then made a foray above the pivot while simultaneously creating a reversal formation, you could sell short in anticipation of the price resuming trading back below the pivot point.</span></p>

                                            <p><span>To make things even simpler, you, as a trader, are to close below the previous Low in an up-trend and close above the previous High in a downtrend.</span></p>

                                            <p><strong>Altcoin flipping strategy</strong></p>

                                            <p><span>If you possess a somewhat larger starting capital, we would suggest you divide it into five categories.</span></p>

                                            <p><span>For the sake of an example, let’s say you have 1 bitcoin. Divide it into 5 equal pieces 0.2 Bitcoin each and use 4 pieces to purchase different coins.</span></p>

                                            <p><span>What are the coins you are to invest the 4 pieces? It depends on your capital and the currencies you can afford. The variety of cryptos is also part of the market’s charm.</span></p>

                                            <p><span>Keep an eye on the coin markets and combine this methodology with the Pivot Reversal Strategy to know when to buy and when to sell. This way you ensure a stable source of income from 4 directions and the loss of a bid on 1 coin is irrelevant as long as you win on three others.</span></p>

                                            <p><span>Additionally, the sum you’ve saved in Bitcoin is there with you at all times as a safety net.</span></p>

                                            <p><span>Trade the 4 coins for higher and exchange your wins into bitcoin. Multiply your newtorth in Bitcoin. Divide it by 5. Rinse and repeat until you have your first million.</span></p>

                                            <p><span>Cheers!</span></p>

                                <p>The creative process isn't just "generating ideas." The reality is it's a five-step process, and ideation is only one of those steps. The entire creative process is made up of objective finding, data gathering, problem design, ideation, and selection. Understanding the role of each step enables us to ensure that we generate the most effective solutions. In this course, Stefan Mumaw guides us through the five steps and then shows us what the complete process looks like, with a real-world project: designing a website.</p>
