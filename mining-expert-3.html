                                <h2 id="Section:Mining,Level:Expert,Course:3(Copy)-Disclaimer"><strong><em>Disclaimer</em></strong></h2>
                                <p><em><span>We’ve briefly talked about mining pools in our previous courses so, by this point, you should get the whole concept behind them. If not – I highly encourage you to check out the previous entries. They are filled with useful information (like what is a hash function and how it works, etc.) that is crucial for better understanding of what I am going to say right now.</span></em></p>
                                <p><em><span>I would also love to point out that this course is a method for me to share my personal experience with you guys.

                                <h2 id="text1"><strong>What is a mining pool?</strong></h2>
                                <p><span>First of all – congrats guys – you’ve made it to the last course from our crypto mining education series. That’s impressive, to say the least. Don’t pat yourself on the back just yet. Yes, we are at the finish line, but it’s always the last couple of inches that are the hardest.</span></p>
                                <p><span>In our case, before we reach the finish line, we need to understand what mining pools are, how they are used and why we may prefer them over solo mining efforts in some cases.</span></p>
                                <p><span>Let’s start with something easy: What is a mining pool exactly? It is a union,<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>a joined group of miners who choose to combine their computing resources into a single network</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>that is more powerful than any solo individual is.</span>
                                </p>
                                <p><span>This brings in a series of benefits, such as mitigation of the ever-growing network complexity and faster cracking of blocks. But such an approach also brings a few disadvantages: the rewards are split between all members of the pool and if your contribution was smaller than the ones of other pool members, you may get a smaller share of profit for it.</span></p>
                                <p><span>But doesn’t such an approach suck? I mean, why share when you can crack blocks and get the entirety of the reward for yourself?</span></p>
                                <p><span>Well, you know what they say – it is the little pig that eats the most. Just think about it. What does your rig give you? 335 megahashes per second? More? Less? Well, a pool that is comprised of six rigs will generate the whopping cumulative two gigahashes per second! Imagine a speed boost at this scale and how frequently the rewards will be coming in, even if split by six.</span></p>
                                <h2 id="text2"><strong>The role of the pool</strong></h2>
                                <p><span>A mining pool is not just a gathering of like-minded people and their computers. The pool coordinates its members. It serves as the CEO and managing director while the hash functions of the rigs are its employees.</span></p>
                                <p><span>The pool is a great manager at that. It knows how much effort each team member has dedicated towards the common goal of gaining the P-o-W and it spreads the rewards accordingly.</span></p>
                                <p><span>How does it know which party did what? Because the pool itself assigns the work to each member. This is usually done in one of two ways:</span></p>
                                <p><span>- &nbsp;&nbsp;The more traditional approach works as follows: the pool simply breaks down the amount of nonce between the members. <span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="f2ca4c4c-ebd2-47e0-b92a-b1b49346b6d3">Nonce</span>, as you may remember from previous courses, is the number that the miners are racing for. This spread amount of work is called a unit. Once one miner is done with his share, that miner places a request to get a new unit.</span>
                                </p>
                                <p><span>- &nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a more liberal approach to assigning units: miners themselves choose the volumes of work they wish to perform and the pool simply keeps track of their combined and individual efforts. This is also a somewhat better approach as it eradicates the possibility of two miners working on the same unit.</span></p>
                                <h2 id="text3"><strong>Rewards, rewards, rewards!</strong></h2>
                                <p><span>Now that we know how a pool works and how it manages miners it is safe to presume that there is only one type of possible reward: you are paid for the amount of work you did. Simple, yes. But such a statement is also false to some extent.</span></p>
                                <p><span>The thing is, the rewards are shared on a pool-specific mechanism. Each pool may support a different mechanism out of several possible types.</span></p>
                                <p><span>Before we get to that point, let’s talk about the possible types of shares.</span></p>
                                <p><span>- &nbsp;&nbsp;An accepted share: this is basically a share that gets a reward. Accepted shares are those that indicate the actual value a miner contributed towards cracking the block.</span></p>
                                <p><span>- &nbsp;&nbsp;A rejected share: If your work did little to contribute towards actually cracking the block, you will not be rewarded at all. This seems fair and all, but the possibility of owning a rejected share implies that you are to keep investing in better, faster hardware because if you do the job fine, but submit it a tiny bit late, you will still get a rejected share.</span></p>
                                <p><span>All the above noted, both types of shares don’t actually have any value. The pool uses them as a tracking and accounting mechanism that dictates who gets the rewards.</span></p>
                                <p><span>What really matters here is the payment method that allows you to cash out your share. There are several types of these methods that pools may or may not support, so choose wisely before getting in.</span></p>
                                <h3 id="Section:Mining,Level:Expert,Course:3(Copy)-PPS"><strong>PPS</strong></h3>
                                <p><span>The Pay-Per-Share method or simply PPS is as simple as a plank. It allows for you to cash out based on the number of shares you own. The more you invest, the more you will get. The math is quite simple here. Do note that PPS is an instantaneous withdrawal method where you can get what you’ve earned at any point of time from the pool’s existing balance.</span></p>
                                <h3 id="Section:Mining,Level:Expert,Course:3(Copy)-SMPPS"><strong>SMPPS</strong></h3>
                                <p><span>This method is called the Shared Maximum of Pay per Share. It works pretty much like the previous withdrawal method with a slight difference. <span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="0e0f636e-74f8-4a5b-a7df-2abfd5427bab">The</span>&nbsp;amount you can withdraw is limited by the maximum withdrawal cap accepted by the pool.</span>
                                </p>
                                <h3 id="Section:Mining,Level:Expert,Course:3(Copy)-ESMPPS"><strong>ESMPPS</strong></h3>
                                <p><span>An Equalized Shared Maximum of Pay per Share is also a variable of the earlier two types that combines two worlds and has yet another limitation: all of the payments are always distributed equally among the pool members.</span></p>
                                <h3 id="Section:Mining,Level:Expert,Course:3(Copy)-PROP"><strong>PROP</strong></h3>
                                <p><span>The proportional withdrawal method or simply PROP offers to cash out the amount that is equal to the total shares gained after every round of mining.</span></p>
                                <p><span>There are also other withdrawal methods available in pools like the Bitcoin-specific BPM but there are way too many to cover in a single course. That is why I’ve chosen to focus on the most frequent and important of the bunch. It should be enough to give you a feel of the difference and choose the pool you wish to invest computing resources into wisely.</span></p>
                                <p><span>You are to also remember that there are fees many of the pools charge for their “management services”. The pools typically charge anything from 1% to 3%, which doesn’t seem like much but really stacks up after a while so watch out – you have been warned.</span></p>
                                <h2 id="text4"><strong>Types of mining pools</strong></h2>
                                <p><span>Just like with payment and withdrawal methods there are also several types of pools. Two, to be precise. The first type is a p2Pool. It is a decentralized mining pool that creates a brand new peer-to-peer network out of the submitted rigs.</span></p>
                                <p><span>Such a pool creates an entirely new blockchain network and has its own network difficulty. That means that a new block may be found every 30 seconds and not every 10 minutes. This chain is called the share chain.</span></p>
                                <p><span>How does this work?</span></p>
                                <p><span>Whenever a member of the network “announces” that the block has been found, the network verifies it, just like it would in the Bitcoin chain. The only difference is that this block is not a Bitcoin. It is a share and it can be both an accepted or a rejected one. It is the job of the pool’s network to verify found shares against actual blocks of the Bitcoin chain and then, after a match is found, the block is considered cracked. Or, in other words, the network will continue finding shares until one of them meets with the established Bitcoin difficulty target.</span></p>
                                <p><span>This method is better than its younger brother in terms of security and stability, and yet it is almost never used nowadays, because the benefits of the Pushpool outshine the potential security risks for many people.</span></p>
                                <p><span>So what is a Pushpool? &nbsp;It is an open source server that uses the HTTP (not HTTPS) JSON-RPC proxies to back the mining processes. It adds a lot of flexibility and advanced customization capabilities thanks to its own open source nature, but it does not come with a user interface. You will have to make and tweak it yourself to fit your needs.</span></p>
                                <p><span>That flexibility, also a drawback for the less savvy users, is a great boost of speed and calculative power. It is also a better tool for the pool’s manager to use as it allows more freedom of movement. I mean, come on, if you can have custom settings for everything from the GPU to your fan, can you really miss out on such an opportunity?</span></p>
                                <h2 id="text5"><strong>Mining pool VS solo mining</strong></h2>
                                <p><span>Now that we know the basics, the time has come to compare solo mining to mining in a pool. Is it better to mine faster and share the rewards, or should you stick to the one-man-army approach and get all of the juicy BTC to yourself?</span></p>
                                <p><span>For starters, your choice has to be dictated by the fee. If you agree to pay it and don’t see the reason not to, the pool should be your weapon of choice for a simple reason: it is stable.</span></p>
                                <p><span>Why does this happen? Because of the nature of mining. How many Bitcoins will you get per day, week or month? You don’t know! I mean, sure, you know the expected volume that is, say 10 BTC/day. That means that by the end of the month you will get an average of 30 blocks. Or does it? You see, you can’t calculate the guesswork that is mining. Your stats are based on average parameters and you have the same chances of cracking 3 blocks per day or not cracking a single one in a week.</span></p>
                                <p><span>A pool is more stable. You know exactly when, where and how much reward you will get given your input of effort is stable.</span></p>
                                <p><span>That noted, the increase in stability also affects your earnings. Why? Imagine looking for a needle in a hay stock alongside 100 other people. What are the odds of you finding it first? 1 to a 100. And what would happen if you were to team up and share the reward equally? everyone would make a little profit.&nbsp;<span class="inline-comment-marker valid" data-ref="36bfcf57-b195-40db-a27a-74c0c7ed92cc">You will be making 2% to 5% more in a pool</span>. This number should mitigate any fees that you pay.</span>
                                </p>
                                <p><span>That noted, not all that glitters is gold. A pool has a “manager” and once again the greatest strength has become the most painful weakness. You see, the manager or the centralized hub may be subject to hacking attempts or DDOS attacks.</span></p>
                                <h2 id="text6"><strong>The cost of setting up a pool</strong></h2>
                                <p><span>Ok, now that that’s settled, how much does it cost to actually set up a pool?</span></p>

                                <p><span>Ok, now that we know the costs, how profitable is it to set up and host a pool? Let’s say you host a pool for Ethereum. Then you will need 8-12GH/s just to get even with your monthly investments. If you charge a 1% fee those volumes are hard to put your finger on. If you charge a 3% fee than you are more likely to scare away most miners and the profitability will probably stay at the same level.</span></p>
                                <p><span>That noted, with all of the technical background required to set up both hardware and software components make it a preferable choice for you to join a pool rather than owning one.</span></p>
                                <p><span>This useful knowledge brings us to the finish line with one very important question: how to pick a decent mining pool?</span></p>
                                <h2 id="text7"><strong>How to choose a mining pool?</strong></h2>
                                <p><span>- &nbsp;&nbsp;Start with your software. There is a lot of mining software available out there and all of it comes from different manufacturers. It is all based on different architecture types and runs different OS versions. You are to see if the pool of your choosing is compatible with your rig before making any other moves. There are pools that do not support GPU-based mining or specific mining software packages and you have to take all of that into account.</span></p>
                                <p><span>- &nbsp;&nbsp;Task assignment and withdrawal. As &nbsp;I’ve mentioned above, there are different types of these mechanisms and you are to choose the pool that fits your earning goals best.</span></p>
                                <p><span>- &nbsp;&nbsp;Cash out frequency. Yes, the withdrawal in a pool is always more stable than the erratic solo-mining, but this stability is gained through maintaining clear payment intervals. Do you feel like waiting a set amount of time that is always pool-specific?</span></p>
                                <p><span>- &nbsp;&nbsp;Size matters. A lot of miners believe that the number of mined coins is proportional to the amount of devices in the pool. A pool of six devices connected into a network will obviously mine less coin than a pool of 100 devices but the shares are spread equally, hence the rewards should be the same in both cases. Right? Wrong! Larger pools simply have a much higher probability of finding blocks because they have more computing power. Sure. The rewards are distributed equally between the members in both cases, but with a bigger network there are simply more rewards to share in the first place.</span></p>
                                <p><span>- &nbsp;&nbsp;The brand. Is the pool new or does it have a history and an armada of satisfied evangelists backing it up? The latter option is obviously the more trustworthy one.</span></p>

The entire creative process is made up of objective finding, data gathering, problem design, ideation, and selection. Understanding the role of each step enables us to ensure that we generate the most effective solutions.
