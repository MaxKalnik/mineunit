                                <h2 id="text1"><span>Long-term crypto trading</span></h2>

                                <p><span>Long-term trading is a well-known practice amongst traders in more traditional niches like Forex or stock exchange. The name of the practice is pretty self-explanatory, and yet there are a series of differences when it comes to the crypto market.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Just like with traditional trading, long-term trade is less trade, per se, but more of an investment opportunity. That noted, traditional investors usually wait several years for their opportunities to blossom while crypto investors do not have such a luxury.</span></p>

                                <p><span>The market of cryptocurrencies is simply too volatile. Long-term crypto investors usually gather profits during a span of a few months to a year, and this is one of the biggest differences between traditional and crypto investing.</span></p>

                                <p><span>But wait! If the market is extremely volatile, how does it make sense to invest in it with the future in mind? That’s a fair question to ask. And the easy answer would be: because there’s more money in it. The bigger the risks, the higher the profits. It’s as simple as that.</span></p>

                                <p><span>The more complex answer would include a series of benefits that go as follows:</span></p>

                                <p><span>-<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Long-term crypto trading has a proven track record:</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>The entire blockchain-based market tends to grow larger with a positive dynamic over the course of the years. This is proven by the S&amp;P 500 index that shows a 60% ROI rate over the course of 5 years. The FTSE 100 also shows a decent ROI of 25% over the same time period.</span>
                                </p>

                                <p><span>-<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>The risks are actually lower:</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>The risk of losing an investment is lower than in short-term trading. You make fewer deals which means you have the chance to analyze every decision you make perfectly, and you have the time to dip out if such a need arises without losing too much. Large-scale investments usually do not turn into dust overnight like the smaller ones tend to do.</span>
                                </p>

                                <p><span>-<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>The fees are lower:</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>You don't pay a lot of fees per every trade. Scalpers tend to make hundreds of transactions per day. Each of them comes with a fee. You have the luxury of investing once and paying once a few months after the initial investment. Needless to say, you pay the fee out of your profits and not out of your own pocket.</span>
                                </p>

                                <p><strong>- ICOs offer new opportunities for long-term investors</strong><span>: You might be among the first to have the new "Bitcoin-Ultra-Prime-Supreme" or whatever other fancy currency of that time on your hands.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Still, long-term investments are not a walk in the park. They come with a series of disadvantages, like:</span></p>

                                <p><span>-<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>An immense starting capital is required.</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>You do not want to get into this niche with less than $50K upfront. More is preferable.</span>
                                </p>

                                <p><span>-<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>It takes a while for you to make a profit.</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>A year is a long time to wait.</span>
                                </p>

                                <p><span>-<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>As we were saying, a year is a long time to wait.</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>A lot may happen over the course of 6 to 12 months and if your investment fails, the losses are much higher than with short-term trading.</span>
                                </p>

                                <p><span>Ok, now that we’ve put the pros and the cons upfront it’s time to talk business, starting with the appropriate method of asset evaluation.</span></p>

                                <h2 id="text2"><span>Is it a good long-term investment?</span></h2>

                                <p><span>How does one know whether a new coin or an ICO is a good long-term investment opportunity or a bad one? Through paying attention to value indicators. This evaluation is performed through detailed analysis of the opportunity.</span></p>

                                <h3 id="Section:Trading;Level:Savvy;Course:3(Copy)-Marketshare"><strong>Market share</strong></h3>

                                <p><span>Realising the market share of a coin is integral. If a currency has a larger share than other currencies you are free to presume that it dominates the niche. Take Bitcoin for example - it is the most known cryptocurrency up-to-date. There are 240+ other currencies on the market that are worth more than a dollar and yet all of them combined make 60% of the market.&nbsp;<span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="22e4fd5f-3443-47bc-a866-1ffc6cde5788">The other 40% is pure BTC</span>.</span>
                                </p>

                                <p><span>Market share alone, however, can not serve as a valuable indicator as new currencies and ICO offerings are emerging on a day-to-day basis and some of them might bring in more profit to investors than Bitcoin ever could.</span></p>

                                <h3 id="Section:Trading;Level:Savvy;Course:3(Copy)-Utilityvalue"><strong>Utility value</strong></h3>

                                <p><span>The utility value is measured with whether the users have a use for a certain coin. If they do, the price will go up. This is why you have to pay attention to the utility value of the coin.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Take a look at Litecoin for example. It is based on a global open source payment network that offers faster rates of block generation. It is particularly interesting to developers and IT specialists because of its tech-savvy nature, and given how IT people make the lion’s share of the blockchain community, Litecoin became the silver to Bitcoin’s Gold.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Ethereum is also a fine example of a currency with high utility value. This currency has earned its place in the top 3 thanks to the smart contracts technology it brought to the table. Smart contracts are used to ensure operations between parties without the involvement of a third-party regulator. If the work is done, the payment is received and that’s the only way it can be.</span></p>

                                <h3 id="Section:Trading;Level:Savvy;Course:3(Copy)-Transactionvalue"><strong>Transaction value</strong></h3>

                                <p><span>Transaction value is also an important indicator that shows whether the currency is used or not in the first place. <span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="bbaeee52-fabb-4916-8a9f-cd266194d712">You are to evaluate the amount of coin used or traded on a daily basis to later realize if that number is growing at a firm, steady scale. Do note that the real transaction volumes and the ones shown in the exchange platform are different. Pay attention to the real deal.&nbsp;</span></span>
                                </p>

                                <p><span>A currency that is increasingly used overtime is the best long-term investment, while a currency that may have kicked off with a loud bang yet is forgotten in a couple of months is not.</span></p>

                                <h3 id="Section:Trading;Level:Savvy;Course:3(Copy)-Thetechjuice"><strong>The tech juice</strong></h3>

                                <p><span>Cryptocurrencies are, first and foremost, elements of technology. They are made by people and are based on existing laws of programming.</span></p>

                                <p><span>If the team behind the currency is slacking there will be countless bugs and glitches in the coin's ecosystem, which may result in great financial losses.</span></p>

                                <p><span>If the technology that has been used for development is outdated, then re-designing the currency from scratch might be too big of a challenge in the long run and the currency will not hold its own against the competition.</span></p>

                                <p><span>If the technology and the team behind the currency are flawless (which never happens) but the tech itself does not serve any purpose to the community, that currency is useless or dead from the box.</span></p>

                                <p><span>It is your job to learn about the tech behind the investment before making a decision. Yes, long-term crypto investments are reserved for the tech-savvy.</span></p>

                                <h3 id="Section:Trading;Level:Savvy;Course:3(Copy)-Thenews"><strong>The news</strong></h3>

                                <p><span>Lastly, the press and community feedback are important indicators. Just check out what the market is saying and learn about potential problems with the coin that are either addressed by the developer or not.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Do note that great press might result in a short-term spike in value that will be followed by a long fall. You will either have the chance to jump on the hype train with a bullish market, or you’ll just have to wait and buy cheap in a bearish market.</span></p>

                                <h2 id="text3"><span>ICOs</span></h2>

                                <p><span>ICOs or Initial Coin Offerings are brand new coins a party is offering to the public for the first time. They cannot be exchanged or trade<span class="inline-comment-marker valid" data-ref="337210f7-b9d6-4ed4-82b6-6838fa0d252f">r</span>. The only way to get ICO coins is to purchase them from the company that made them.</span>
                                </p>

                                <p><span><span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="103424b8-d49c-45bd-adf3-5941e03e830b">You trade Bitcoin or other altcoins for ICO coins, the company uses that money to fund the project and</span>, after their work is complete, the coins are released to the public. This works as follows: a&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);">project will be able to receive the coin via their smart contract or via their investor cabinet, then after pre- or main- sale(depends on the stage you send the money) you will get their coins to your address.</span></span>
                                </p>

                                <p><span>In theory, they will be the new black of the cryptocurrency market and you, as the holder of a large share of the coin, will get fabulously rich. That’s just theory, however.</span></p>

                                <p><span>In practice, you are working blindfolded when investing in ICOs. The coins have no history, nor do they have a proven track record. You just don't have any data to base your judgment on other than industry-related news and understanding of the technology or its potential usefulness.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Yes, ICOs come with great risk, yet the rewards are ever so tempting. Only a handful of people get their hands on the coin during the ICO and those who’ve missed their chance will purchase the coin as soon as it is live simply because that’s when it will be the cheapest.</span></p>

                                <p><span>This, in turn, will raise the price of the coin, making an ICO the perfect definition of the "buy low sell high" phenomenon. A 10%-50% ROI is guaranteed if you choose the right ICO like Ethereum back in the day.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Another important factor to know about an ICO is that they often have a cap, meaning they only offer a set amount of coin and, even upon release, if all the coin was taken by investors the market will have to wait longer for new coins to be produced.</span></p>

                                <p><span>This, in theory, may raise the price of the coin even higher through the generation of controlled demand, yet it may also backfire as the community may forget about the coin in the first place. A fast-paced market like ours moves on quickly.</span></p>

                                <h2 id="text4"><span>Long-term trading strategies</span></h2>

                                <h3 id="Section:Trading;Level:Savvy;Course:3(Copy)-Theaccumulativestrategy"><strong>The accumulative strategy</strong></h3>

                                <p><span>The epiphany of the accumulative strategy is simple: buy as much Bitcoin (or another coin) as you can afford and sit on it for as long as possible. So the shorter version of this strategy would be buying low and selling high in a couple of years.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Easier said than done, right?</span></p>

                                <p><span>The trouble kicks off at the very start. How can you buy low? Sure, with a long-term strategy the entry point isn't as important as it is with scalping, but the less the price now, the higher the ROI later, so why not go all in from the start?</span></p>

                                <p><span>It seems like the real issue here is the volatility of the market. You just don’t know if it’s the prices that went down for good or maybe it was another bump on Bitcoin’s way up?</span></p>

                                <p><span>Here’s the thing - you don’t have to know. You just mustn't care at the moment. Use the sudden ripples to your advantage: place your order that is 15-30% down from the current price and wait for the magic to happen.</span></p>

                                <p><span>The next step would be for you to remain calm. The volatility of the market can range from 5% to even 20% daily, although it usually never exceeds 10%.</span></p>

                                <p><span>What this means is that you are to (at your own risk) neglect automated stop losses. Don’t just sell everything when the price is going down drastically. This may work with fiat money, but not with Bitcoin.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Half-measures will lead you nowhere.</span></p>

                                <p><span>You must be fully aware of the amount of money you are willing to lose. Make that amount your permanent showstopper and ignore the spikes and ripples.</span></p>

                                <p><span>The exit strategy here is a bit more interesting and action-packed. You actually have several exit options:</span></p>

                                <p><span>- Hold your investment for as long as possible.</span></p>

                                <p><span>- Start selling steadily at specific levels. Divide your investment by five or ten and sell each piece every time the resistance fades and Bitcoin breaks a new market cap. It will go down in price back to the norm eventually, but if the market is bullish enough - why not sell a share?</span></p>

                                <h3 id="Section:Trading;Level:Savvy;Course:3(Copy)-HedgeStrats"><strong>Hedge Strats</strong></h3>

                                <p><span>Who says you are limited to long-term investments alone? Feel free to combine the accumulative strategy with the daily trade strategies we’ve mentioned in the previous courses.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Split the Bitcoin you have into equal shares of 50%. Invest the first half long-term and use the second half for daily trades.</span></p>

                                <p><span>This way while the first 50% you are sitting on is safe and waiting for the right price, the other 50% is put to good use and make a profit on a day-to-day basis.</span></p>

                                <p><span>How? Easy - you know this stuff: Divide your active 50% into five shares, perform the technical analysis of new currencies and invest in the best of them.</span></p>

                                <h2 id="text5"><span>Common trading mistakes you are to avoid</span></h2>

                                <p><span>What is the greatest danger a long-term trader faces? Is it the volatility of the market? Is it the threat of a sudden collapse?</span></p>

                                <p><span>Nope, the most common danger a trader faces is the trader himself. You are your biggest problem.</span></p>

                                <h3 id="Section:Trading;Level:Savvy;Course:3(Copy)-Weneedareason"><strong>We need a reason</strong></h3>

                                <p><span>The human mind works in mysterious ways. For starters, we always need a reason for something to happen. That’s just how we evolved as a species - through finding reason and cause. If lightning strikes a tree it catches fire. If meat is put in said fire, it tastes better. Meat can’t taste better on itself. It needs fire, ergo the tribe prays to the lightning gods. Do not be a caveman!</span></p>

                                <p><span>We do the same with trading all the time. We tend to confuse random facts with a chain of events. An example: oh, wow, there are these amazing people on the board of directors for this ICO. They’ve made one great ICO product earlier which means they will do it again!</span></p>

                                <p><span>No, it goddamned doesn't. The only way to evaluate an ICO is through analysis of its value, technology, press hype, and attention from the community. The board of directors takes a great part in all of it but they DO NOT guarantee success. Public demand does.</span></p>

                                <h3 id="Section:Trading;Level:Savvy;Course:3(Copy)-Wewaitfortheperfectmoment"><strong>We wait for the perfect moment</strong></h3>

                                <p><span>The perfect moment never happens. If you wish to enter the market - do it now. Use a temporary decline in the price to buy cheap and sit on your investment until the time is right.</span></p>

                                <p><span>The longer you wait - the more chances you are missing out on.</span></p>

                                <h3 id="Section:Trading;Level:Savvy;Course:3(Copy)-Changingastrategyaccordingtothemarket’sdemand"><strong>Changing a strategy according to the market’s demand</strong></h3>

                                <p><span>This is a big no-no. The market is known to change. That’s why we are all here - to make money on these changes. That is also the reason for us to have a strategy. You just can't expect to earn a lot in the long run if you will be following every curve of the charts and adapting.</span></p>

                                <p><span>What works for scalpers does not work for you.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Your strategy is a constant. Once chosen, let the world burn but stick to it!</span></p>
