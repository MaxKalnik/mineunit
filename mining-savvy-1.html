We will provide the answers to these and other questions over the most compelling course on crypto mining up-to-date</p>


                                <h2 id="text1"><strong>Why are you here?</strong></h2>
                                <p><span>$12.8 Million. This is the latest mining reward for the past 24 hours (at least at the moment we wrote this course). Hold on for a moment. Let that thought sink in.</span></p>
                                <p><span>Miners have earned nearly thirteen million dollars during the course of one day and one night in Bitcoin alone. There are 1.600+ other currencies out there. If this is not a good enough reason to get a slice of the mining pie for yourself, what is?</span></p>
                                <p><span>Not only that but you probably have a friend who has a mate who has a sister, and that sister’s uncle has made a fortune mining. This is not exactly what one might call “from the first hands” info, right? But it is enough to light a spark. “I can do the same”, you think. “But can I?”</span></p>
                                <p><span>Can you?</span></p>
                                <p><span>Technically, you can. Without a doubt. &nbsp;Alas, as it always is with money, free cheese can only be found in a mousetrap. Mining is pretty much a day-to-day business that requires skill, dedication, and a fair share of investment.</span></p>
                                <p><span>The “I want to make money out of air” mindset doesn’t work and it will not deliver any results without help. You have Mineunit, our technological know-how and industry expertise on your side for that. But if you wish to mine on your own, please put on your entrepreneur hat. You will need it. A lot.</span></p>
                                <p><span>But where does your journey start? At an in-depth look at what mining really is, of course!</span></p>
                                <h2 id="text2"><strong>Crypto mining in a nutshell</strong></h2>
                                <p><span>Mining stands on two whales. The first one is the process of <span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="f5d8ad6d-d864-4577-aded-3b9e985d9a51">adding transactions into the blockchain network</span> and the other is the creation of new currencies and finding the <span class="inline-comment-marker valid" data-ref="8298e2db-fdbe-48bb-9b2e-74d57e80a818">nonse</span> to generate these blocks. To do that a miner needs sophisticated hardware and software components that form a mining rig.</span>
                                </p>
                                <p><span>Essentially, mining is a race. The kind in which the best car wins and not the best racer. Computers and specialized software do the powerlifting without any involvement from your side. This is both a great feat and a colossal pain for crypto enthusiasts. On one side, you can set up a rig and kick back while the hardware generates a steady revenue stream and on the other, you have to compete with the calculative power of different miners. You can’t outsmart the competition, you can’t earn more through life hacks or shortcuts. Your only option is to create a rig that outperforms other players.</span></p>
                                <p><span>That noted, both the hardware and mining difficulty alter over time, hence you will need to update your rig on a regular basis. Do you need us to say how expensive new graphics cards or ASIC chips are?</span></p>
                                <h2 id="text3"><strong>Crypto mining in detail</strong></h2>
                                <p><span>Let’s start with a simple fact: mining is designed to be difficult. It is meant to be resource-intensive and it is developed in a way in which the difficulty scales and grows alongside new computing power. The blockchain is designed in this way for a simple reason: to keep a steady number of new blocks per day.</span></p>
                                <p><span>Now that we’ve covered the difficulty it is time to finally debunk one of the largest myths about mining: miners don’t actually create coins. At least not necessarily, as there are some exceptions, especially when it comes to new currencies. The network rewards miners with Bitcoin for their activity and verification of previous transactions in the Blockchain.</span></p>
                                <p><span>The verification process works as follows: mining software and hardware rigs solve complex mathematical puzzles that add new blocks into the chain. This is done via the cryptographic Hash function.</span></p>
                                <h3 id="Section:Mining,Level:Savvy,Course:1(Copy)-What’sahash?"><strong>What’s a hash?</strong></h3>
                                <p><span>A hash function is a one-way encryption that does not have a key. It takes the input of the miner and returns an array of symbols. They might seem like gibberish, but in reality, they are always the same length. This is called the hash value. The value will change according to the input. And this is where the fun starts.</span></p>
                                <p><span>One may not predict all of the variables that may or may not be inputted. It’s simply impossible. This is why the hash function is not used for encryption or decryption of input per se, but is rather a means for finding pairs in a large pile of symbol threads. This is how the hash function is used for validation or proof of work.</span></p>
                                <p><span><span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="f7f68b61-5f9b-4e08-93f3-dcbc990dc5f8">Miners are the ones who are actually finding the match between the input and the encryption. <span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);">They search for <span class="inline-comment-marker valid" data-ref="50568edd-eaba-4d93-a19c-c82072444847">nonse</span> which will be hashed with other block header values and this hash must be less or equal to the previous blocks' hash.&nbsp;</span>You use the rig to pick from countless variables until the rig finds something that is lesser than the target. Be the first one to get there and congrats – you’ve mined the block.</span>
                                    </span>
                                </p>
                                <p><span>Sounds simple? Well, it kind of is if you forget the fact that a computer hast to randomly pick billions of variables until the match is found.</span></p>
                                <p><span>The beauty of this approach lies in simplicity. You simply can’t cheat at something that is blind guesswork, hence every participant of the network is on equal terms with each other.</span></p>
                                <p><span>The hash function walks hand to hand with the creation of new blocks. The latter are based on the data from the previous block’s hash. This is how the blocks “prove” themselves as the ones coming after the initial block.</span></p>
                                <h3 id="Section:Mining,Level:Savvy,Course:1(Copy)-P-o-W"><strong>P-o-W</strong></h3>
                                <p><span>We have briefly mentioned the P-o-W, or the Proof of Work earlier, but what is it, really?&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);">Proof of work or P-o-W is a requirement that requires expensive computations (also called mining) that are performed in order to facilitate transactions on the blockchain. Or, in simpler words, a</span><span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="8755e40b-3637-4224-9b4b-33b08c0ecfac">A P-o-W is an element of data that is hard to come by. The production of said data has specific requirements that are either time-consuming or resource-intensive.</span></span>
                                </p>
                                <p><span>Here is a cool fact for you: generation of a valid P-o-W is a complex process and the probability of success is very low. This is why they are built based on a lot of – you’ve guessed it – trial and error.</span></p>
                                <h2 id="text4"><strong>Mining Difficulty</strong></h2>
                                <p><span>Ok, now that we know about the hash and the P-o-W, the time has come to actually talk about how mining difficulty works.</span></p>
                                <p><span>Let’s use the SHA-256 (the hash of Bitcoin) as an example. The <span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="091f0e96-6113-4d5e-bf2f-b617cacfffc8">hash of the block's header</span> has to either be lower or equal to the target value. Otherwise the block just won’t be accepted into the network. The issue here is that blocks are forced to start with a whole lot of zeroes. For the sake of an example: Imagine finding a number that is smaller than 0000000000000000000.1! And now imagine millions of machines outracing you while doing the same task while the initial block strings get more and more zeroes.</span>
                                </p>
                                <p><span>Now that we’ve started with bitcoin it is also important to note that it (as any other network) has a set mining difficulty. The “network mining difficulty” is a measurement of how hard it is to find a block at any given moment of time if compared to when it was the easiest.</span></p>
                                <p><span>This leads to simple math: the more miners join the crowd, the more blocks are found, the higher the difficulty to find the next block. The 10 minute interval, remember?</span></p>
                                <p><span>Don’t worry too much though. The “simplest” mined block is not the first block, as it would simply be impossible to continue mining in such a network over but a few months or even days. <span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="4a4787af-ddde-4ea6-bee6-9399262677a3">The entry point or the simplest block is recalculated after every 2016 blocks are added.</span></span>
                                </p>
                                <h2 id="text5"><strong>The rewards</strong></h2>
                                <p><span>Ok, I guess all of you came here for one simple reason: the money. Well, why wait any longer, let’s talk about the rewards.</span></p>
                                <p><span>Whenever a block is mined, the last person working on it (aka the last machine that cracked the code and has the P-o-W) is rewarded. With how much? Well. That depends on the network. Every member of the network always agrees upon the amount of coin granted per every cracked block, hence the rewards are pre-determined.</span></p>
                                <p><span>At the moment of me writing these words the reward was <span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="7cee0a02-8a85-4593-9c9a-1e51d79908d8">12.5 Bitcoins</span>. Seems like a lot, but the odds are it is much smaller now as the value halves after every 210.000 blocks are cracked. Bummer, right?</span>
                                </p>
                                <p><span>But hold on for one second. There is more – the miner is also rewarded with a segment of the fees senders pay per transaction, which is nice.</span></p>
                                <h2 id="text6"><strong>Mining hardware</strong></h2>
                                <p><span>Ok guys, hold onto your pants – the moment of truth has come. You are now 100% aware of how mining works and why it so god damned difficult. The time has come to show off hardware and talk money. Are you ready to learn about the juicy insides of a mining rig?</span></p>
                                <p><span>Buckle up, boys and girls; we are in for one hell of a ride!</span></p>
                                <h3 id="Section:Mining,Level:Savvy,Course:1(Copy)-Thecase"><strong>The case</strong></h3>
                                <p><span>Let’s kick things off at a slower pace, starting with a rig case. Your miner needs a solid foundation, does it not?</span></p>
                                <p><span>Frames for miners are usually not much more than a frame made of aluminum or any other material. The frames don’t usually look too good, nor dies a miner after it’s built simply because you can see the insides, the wires, the fans and whatnot.</span></p>
                                <p><span>But why don’t suppliers make fancier cases that look great? For one simple reason, of course: miners get hot fast. A few extra walls around the frame may result in wasted GPU cards. &nbsp;In case you didn’t know – GPU cards get very-very-very hot while computing.</span></p>
                                <p><span>There is also another, slightly less impactful reason: space. You can put more inside an open-air case than inside a box.</span></p>
                                <p><span>Ok, we get it. We need an open-aired frame. Seems simple enough right? Not really, as the distributors have a nasty habit of adding a few zeroes to every mining-related products. An aluminum frame may cost as much (if not more) as a gaming PC case.</span></p>
                                <p><span>That noted, a store isn’t the only solution: there are dozens of cases sold over the internet made from anything from planks to cola crates. This leaves you with three choices: buy a case for $100+, buy a used crate from miners for less, make your own case or use mineunit. We’ve managed to solve the heating problem through clever designs of ventilation channels and our rig will look great in your living room.</span></p>
                                <h2 id="Section:Mining,Level:Savvy,Course:1(Copy)-Themotherboard"><strong>The motherboard</strong></h2>
                                <p><span>Some might say that the motherboard is not an important element of a mining rig. You have my permission to kick them in the face. I mean, sure, it doesn’t do all of the powerlifting. But it is the key that keeps the entire system together and operational.</span></p>
                                <p><span>Another important factor that affects the motherboard is the number of sockets. You’ll want as much as you can get because you will need to plug a lot of GPU cards in.</span></p>
                                <p><span>Your safest bet would be to go along with gaming gear, as they are usually the most socket-rich fellers on the market. Asus, MSI, Gygabyte – all of these bad boys qualify.</span></p>
                                <p><span>That noted, if you go all in and play around with the cool kids on the block, the likes of Asus B250 Mining Expert cards are the go-to choice. Do you know how many GPU cards it supports? 19! 19, Coral!</span></p>
                                <h2 id="Section:Mining,Level:Savvy,Course:1(Copy)-TheCPU&amp;RAM"><strong>The CPU &amp; RAM</strong></h2>
                                <p><span>There is no point stopping here for long. The CPU you can get your hands on is your CPU. Period. I mean, sure, it can’t be ancient, but any decent multi-core processor that supports 4-8 gigs of RAM will do the trick.</span></p>
                                <h2 id="Section:Mining,Level:Savvy,Course:1(Copy)-TheGPU"><strong>The GPU</strong></h2>
                                <p><span>Graphics Cards, my friends, is where the fun begins. The best GPUs for mining (as of this moment) are the heavy hitters from AMD or Nvidia. If you have the likes of Vega S6 or a shiny new GTX 1070 – you are in luck. They should not cost more than $400, but do note that you will need at least 4 of them.</span></p>
                                <p><span>If you do your shopping right, you will find discounts and special deals on sets of graphics cards. They are usually reserved for store owners, but hey, if you can buy a set of six cards for the price of five – why not take the chance?</span></p>
                                <p><span>Great, now that that we know which card to grab let us figure out why bother in the first place. Why are GPUs preferred over CPUs for mining? Well, because they are not that different: both are used to run processes at high speeds. It is the type of process that matters.</span></p>
                                <p><span>A CPU, for example, can execute 4 32-bit instructions per clock if it uses the 128-bit SSE or 8, if it uses a 256-bit instruction. The graphics card, on the other hand, can execute 3000+ 32-bit instructions per clock. This is an 800 times difference!</span></p>
                                <h2 id="text7"><strong>The ASIC chip</strong></h2>
                                <p><span>This section is reserved for those who firmly believe that playtime is over, so proceed with caution. We are going to talk about big boy mining here!</span></p>
                                <p><span>What is an ASIC chip? An ASIC chip or an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit is a tiny computer in and of itself. It is a machine that was designed and built to manage a single, distinct set of processes. Mining chips are designed and developed with mining in mind and can not be used for anything else. Its laser-sharp precision and determination make the chip the better option for serious mining or work with high-complexity currencies such as bitcoin.</span></p>
                                <p><span>On the downside, the odds of you building an ASIC-based rig are very slim. You’ll have to deal with a lot of coding and specialized software to pull such a feat. This is why ASIC miners are mostly purchased and given the lack of alternatives the price tag bites.</span></p>
                                <h2 id="Section:Mining,Level:Savvy,Course:1(Copy)-AdetailedlookattheASICchip"><strong>A detailed look at the ASIC chip</strong></h2>
                                <p><span>An ASIC chip (at least in terms of mining) is a chip designed with a single purpose – the execution of the hashing algorithm. This sounds cheap on paper, but in reality an ASIC chip is capable of calculating hashes 10000 times faster than any GPU simply because it’s made to do it rather than play games or videos.</span></p>
                                <p><span>Impressive, right? That noted, the bad boys come with a series of disadvantages. Primarily, their design is their greatest strength and the most baffling weakness. A chip that is designed to run one hashing algorithm can’t run them all. This matters because different currencies are based on different algorithms, and your Bitcoin miner won’t manage to mine Ether or any other currency that is based on a different technology.</span></p>
                                <p><span>ASIC chips are also extremely loud. A person will not be able to sleep in the same room with a working ASIC-based miner.</span></p>
                                <p><span>That and the price tag of $3000+ make them a viable solution for only those willing to spare a separate room for the miner on an industrial level.</span></p>

The entire creative process is made up of objective finding, data gathering, problem design, ideation, and selection. Understanding the role of each step enables us to ensure that we generate the most effective solutions. In this course, Stefan Mumaw guides us through the five steps and then shows us what the complete process looks like, with a real-world project: designing a website.</p>
