                                <p>ICO looks like the new cool kid in the crowdfunding block/ But why did it gain enough traction to make almost a quarter of all earning in Bitcoin? Is it a good fit for your business and, if so, how to launch one successfully? The answers are at your fingertips.</p>


                                <h2 id="Section:BfB,Level:Legend,Course:3(Copy)-Disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
                                <p>
                                    <em>Dear reader! The following course is a part of a series, hence we recommend you to finish the previous entries before proceeding. They will have answers, explained concepts and terminology that will not be covered in detail now. </em>
                                    <br><em>The following course is aimed at showing the business potential of blockchain and should not be considered as legal advice, guidance, counsel or a call to action. All the decisions you make after reading this course are your own. </em>
                                <h2 id="text1">The power of ICO</h2>
                                <p>
                                    It was the year 2013. The scientists at CERN confirmed the Higgs Boson, a meteorite fell in Chelyabinsk, but, most importantly, something interesting happened at Ripple Labs. The guys from Ripple were working on a new payment system and they had 100 billion XRP tokens to go with it. These tokens were sold in an attempt to raise money for the development of what we now know as the Ripple platform.
                                    <br>Then Mastercoin came along. They have promised to deliver something new to the Bitcoin network – the functionality that allows for Smart Contracts and generation of Tokens. Mastercoin also came prepared to the show. They had something around a million tokens that were sold for approximately one buck each.
                                    <br>Then, in 2014 Ethereum came to dominate the show. They pulled off the same trick but with a much larger bang. Ethereum has managed to raise a whopping $20 million!
                                    <br>Yes, all of that before their product was even released.
                                    <br>How’d these guys do it? Thanks to an ICO or an Initial Coin Offering we’ve already talked about in the previous courses.
                                    <br>Just in case it somehow slipped your mind an ICO is about offering tokens AKA random units of a yet-to-be-live cryptocurrency in exchange for something with more immediate value like BTC or ETH.</p>
                                <h3 id="Section:BfB,Level:Legend,Course:3(Copy)-ICOVSEquity">ICO VS Equity</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Ok, so ICO’s are basically a somewhat new way of crowdfunding a project. But we have those already. So where does all the hype come from?
                                    <br>Because an ICO creates liquidity rather than equity. You’d be surprised but this difference packs a wallop. An entire quarter of all investments in Blockchain came from ICO’s.
                                    <br>This doesn’t sound right, does it? Traditional investments are an exchange of money for stocks. If a company you have put the time, effort and money in growth – you make a profit and everybody wins.
                                    <br>Except for the times when everybody loses. The owners of a startup are destined to lose a share or even full control over their brainchild, while the investors have to work hard, sometimes in an entire board, to ensure that their dollars are put to good use (by their opinion).
                                    <br>Add the open source nature of the majority of blockchain projects that is usually of zero interest to investors as it is pointless to own a share of something everybody accesses for free and you will get why equity doesn’t really work that well.
                                    <br>Liquidity, on the other hand, is a satisfying substitution to traditional methods. Don’t get this wrong – there are still risks involved but with an exchange of tokens for Bitcoin, the owners of the startup are not risking the loss of control while the investors don’t have to babysit a company. They get a lot of Altcoin for a minimal price and exchange it for profit after a project is released.
                                    <br>Bitcoin was worth a dollar in 2011. Look at its price tag now and imagine how awesome would it be to get your hands on it back then?</p>
                                <h3 id="Section:BfB,Level:Legend,Course:3(Copy)-ICOVSstartup">ICO VS startup</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Some might counter the argument of “everybody wins” with a simple line: a lot of ICO’s are scams. And that person would be right.
                                    <br>There are, indeed, a lot of frauds and schemes in the blockchain network and there are also projects that are going nowhere but oblivion after their coin hits the exchange.
                                    <br>There are still the legal questions regarding investing in an ICO and there are a lot of risks in the filed due to the very nature of the technology. The blockchain is still a young fruit far from being the juicy treat it will once become.
                                    <br>But you know what? 9 out of 10 startups from the Silicon Valley fail miserably. The odds of being successful from both the owner’s and the investor’s point of view is as little as 10%.
                                    <br>Then, if the risks are the all the same, why not go for the one that offers more return on investment?</p>
                                <h3 id="text2">The point of a token</h3>
                                <p>
                                    As good as an ICO may seem it still has its shortcomings. For starters, an ICO might not be applicable to your business or startup. How can you tell?
                                    <br>You’d be surprised, but ICO’s have standards now. Yes, they’ve grown so big over the past few years that the industry had no choice but to adapt and set up the base rules. Sure all of them are “informal” yet it’s best for you to keep up with the expectations of an investor if you are willing to succeed.
                                    <br>Most of the standards revolve around your tokens. Investors are to be convinced that your token will gain value over the course of your business’s lifecycle. This means that the token is to become the heart of your project. Make sure to embed into every branch of ongoing functionality.

                                <p>
                                    - Why does your startup need the blockchain tech in the first place?
                                    <br>- What are the advantages the blockchain brings to the table that other technologies do not?
                                    <br>- Is there a definitive link between blockchain and your project?
                                    <br>- Are there any similar ICO’s on the market?
                                    <br>- If so, how do they do what they do?
                                    <br>- If there aren’t any competitors – why is that? Is your idea truly revolutionary or does it seem like something others are simply not interested in?
                                    <br>- What are the benefits of your currency over other currencies?
                                    <br>- And, lastly, do you break any local or international laws? (you might be surprised, but this is a valid question in the blockchain industry)</p>
                                <h2 id="text3">What does it take to build a blockchain business?</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Building an ICO is a very difficult task. Building a popular ICO is a titanic effort. But the starting steps don’t seem to be that hard. All you need to begin is to have a competitive idea and some research. What should you learn about in the beginning?
                                    <br>- After having a defined idea - check out your competitors.
                                    <br>- Then learn if there is a need for your product on the market. Does it solve any critical pains a wide community of people encounters?
                                    <br>Get your hands on this data and proceed to step 1.</p>
                                <h3 id="Section:BfB,Level:Legend,Course:3(Copy)-Step1–Gatherateam">Step 1 – Gather a team</h3>
                                <p>
                                    This step is somewhat tricky and it depends entirely on the goals you have. Raising $10-100K isn’t that hard and you can work with the people you like regardless of their capabilities or relevant experiences. As long as they do the trick for moving your project further – you are fine.
                                    <br>However, if your goal is beyond the $1 million to $10 million mark – every detail about the people working for you from their age and education to previous projects matter more than gold.
                                    <br>Your team can be divided into three groups: CxO’s like your CEO or CFO of the Head of Marketing, Managers like scrum masters and team leads and employees like developers, community managers, and support operators, etc.
                                    <br>If your team is below 15 people – make sure to provide the bios of all the team members in the Whitepaper or on your site. If your team is above that – include the CxO people and the managers.
                                    <br>Did you know that finding a decent team is the shittiest task for an ICO? The tech is relatively new and a lot of experts are in high demand. It’s rare to find one that’s not busy on a project at any given moment of time.
                                    <br>This problem is usually solved overseas. Your team doesn’t have to be in one city or country. Poland, Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, and Germany have rich pools of professionals. Go phishing there!
                                    <br>Then there are the advisors. There are the top people with a loud name in the industry. They are the influencers with an opinion and a following. Finding them is not a hard task – everyone knows the cool kids on the block.
                                    <br>Getting their attention, on the other hands, can be a chore.
                                    <br>The hardest thing here is there is no distinct methodology of how to pitch top players. They are either interested in your project or not and that decision might be affected by everything from your Whitepaper to a shitty coffee they had just before opening an email from you.
                                    <br>And yet these are the people that make or break the investor’s opinion regarding your project. Make sure to aim high while picking an advisor.</p>
                                <h3 id="Section:BfB,Level:Legend,Course:3(Copy)-Step2–TheWhitepaper">Step 2 – The Whitepaper</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Your whitepaper is your number one weapon in the upcoming battle for attention. It is a physical (or digital) manifestation of your project’s core. In it, you will describe the solutions you bring to the table, talk about your team and so much more.
                                    <br>What should be included in your whitepaper?
                                    <br>- Remember the market analysis you have done before? Showcase the pains your project solves and highlight the need for a painkiller in the community.
                                    <br>- Tal about your team in detail. There have to be compelling, detail-rich bios of every team member. This is done to show the experience of the people behind any given project. Do note that the experience has to be relevant to the niche of your ICO.
                                    <br>- A roadmap. What is the current stage of your project and where will it be in the next six month to a year? Make sure to include as many details here as possible.
                                    <br>- The description of the technologies you’ve used or are planning to use on the project as well as the reasoning behind your tech choices.
                                    <br>Lastly, know who you are writing the paper for. 99% of people who’ve heard about you will not care about it at all. But the 1% that dies is what matters because it is composed of journalists from top media publications and the ‘big buck’ investors with very big pockets and even deeper concerns regarding whether you are a scam or not.</p>

                                <p>
                                    Choosing your currency or token is an intimate process. Just go for what tickles your project’s fancy. Make sure that the coins work for you and are easily embedded into the core of your project.
                                    <br>What are your options?
                                    <br>- Forks: Litecoin branched off Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash branched off Bitcoin. Those things are called forks. If you feel like riding on the hype surrounding a popular currency – this is your safest bet.
                                    <br>- Your own Blockchain: why work with the rules of established networks if you can make something from scratch? This is a more challenging and resource-intensive task, yet it also is the most promising one in terms of raw ROI if done right.
                                    <br><span class="inline-comment-marker valid" data-ref="2a4b58ea-50a8-4eb5-8921-f32a8690ff64">- Your own token: This is the smaller brother of the previous point. You don’t build a new chain from scratch, but you build an entirely new currency based on an existing blockchain like NEO or Ethereum.</span> You can make ETC-based tokens with additional functionality and back them up with smart contracts. This is a nice way to make everyone feel a bit safer. PS – there are also other currencies that allow for the development of tokens on their bases like NXT or <span class="inline-comment-marker valid" data-ref="87692c98-b7ec-4194-86b3-47d40e770033">qtum</span>.

                                    Ok, all theory aside, the time has come to talk business. How does one launch an ICO and succeeds with it?</p>

                                    No, not that kind of confidence. What are we, on a self-esteem webinar or something? We are talking about the confidence of others in your project.
                                    <br>Publicity, especially on the internet, is a mean bunch of people. There will always be haters and those stating that your business is a swindle or a failure. Your job is not to allow their voice to become the dominant one.
                                    <br>Your marketing and public relations game has to be on its top.</p>

                                    Take a look at China – they’ve banned ICO’s on their home turf a while ago. Same happened in South Corea recently. Aiming a launch at this region will be a fatal mistake for your business and you know what – this is but a cherry on the icing.
                                    <br>There are countries where Altcoins are illegal and there are countries where you can pay your taxes with Bitcoin. You have to know all that stuff and avoid the traps of the real-world white collars that are scattered in a lot of tiny nuances. Those seemingly insignificant things can stack up into a demolishing snowball of doom.</p>

                                    The Altcoin community isn’t that small nowadays, yet it is still very tight. News and rumors spread like forest fire.
                                    <br>Successful ICO’s aim up to 70% of their time and resources towards generating and maintaining a community of fans, followers or even advocates. It would be best for you to attract as many influencers and micro influencers as possible in the early stages of your project. Then allow them to “spread a rumor” about something new and awesome coming. This is an amazing way to generate hype.
                                    <br>Now that we’ve slightly covered this subject, the time has come to talk about something very interesting.</p>

                                    First thing’s first – you can’t make everyone love you. Cram that into your head. That doesn’t mean you don’t have to try to make everyone lose their minds over your project. You just shouldn’t care about an occasional hater or heckler.
                                    <br>How do you start?</p>
                                <h3 id="Section:BfB,Level:Legend,Course:3(Copy)-MVP">MVP</h3>
                                <p>An MVP, or the most viable product is an integral element of any successful ICO. Create a functioning backbone for your project and then show it off to the public. This will both show the entire world what you are working on exactly and, at the same time, it will show large investors or funds that there already is something worth their time, attention and money.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Lastly, an MVP is a great indicator of what you can or can't do with current resources. In a world where 74% of high growth startups fail due to premature scaling and those who know their ground grow 20 times faster having this feeling of your product is obligatory at the earliest possible stage.&nbsp;</p>

                                    There are lots of ways to market something from TV ads to live boards. Not a single person in the world can master them all. Nor should anyone try to.
                                    <br>Efficiency has to be the primary focus of your marketing efforts. Know your audience, find out what they love or hate and strike in those precise points.
                                    <br>Here is an example: there are a lot o social media channels. But should you target them all of should you focus on Telegram, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter while forgetting about Pinterest or Instagram?
                                    <br>The answer depends on your audience.
                                    <br>If there is one thing about marketing that we can say for certain without even knowing who your project targets it’s the fact that you are bound to have a bounty program.
                                    <br>Whatever the system, social media platform or country – people are always the same. They are looking for profit and rewarding them for the actions you’ve chosen is a nice way for heating up an interest.
                                    <br>A person brings a friend to your community – give him a token and he will bring more.
                                    <br>Someone shares some news about you on social media – give the guy a token and he will keep sharing.
                                    <br>There is someone willing to pay upfront? Reward that person with more tokens and he will spread the news of your generosity.</p>

                                <h3 id="Section:BfB,Level:Legend,Course:3(Copy)-Thepre-ICO">The pre-ICO</h3>
                                <p>
                                    What is a pre-ICO? It is a test-drive of what your real launch will bring in the future. The pre-ICO is typically a small launch without fanfares that only lasts for a week or so.
                                    <br>Why is it important?
                                    <br>- Pulping the audience: you have gathered a lot of data but, unless it is tested in the real world, the info you possess is very much useless. A small launch will give you the feel of an audience and it will show what triggers people and what doesn’t. gather the intel, make some tweaks and launch with improvements when the time X comes.
                                    <br>- Earning some cash: launching an ICO is expensive. On average it takes $80K out of your pocket. Needless to say, that money runs out quickly and a pre-sale can manage to generate the much needed additional source of revaluing, even if for a while.
                                    <br>- Hype game: the prices for tokens are usually 3-5 times lesser during the pre-ICO stage. A lot of people will be willing to buy as cheap as possible. That’s where you get them and convert them into a loyal audience.</p>
                                <h3 id="Section:BfB,Level:Legend,Course:3(Copy)-CrowdSales">Crowd Sales</h3>

                                    <br>Crowd Sales usually last for a couple of weeks to a couple of months depending on the soft and the hard caps you’ve set up.
                                    <br>You can’t really do anything on this stage rather than maintaining constant communications with your audience.
                                    <br>Share as many news about your ICO as possible. Boats with bright numbers and stats. Share the volumes of subscribers and sold tokens. Do whatever it is that you have to do as long as it helps to avoid silence because as soon as the community is quiet, the sales are as good as dead.
                                    <br>This is also a great time to pitch major news publishers. Make sure to share current numbers and your whitepaper with them as well.</p>

                                    The cap is reached. What’s next?
                                    <br>Well, you’ve made the money. The time has come to start working. A lot.
                                    <br>You can decrease your marketing budget for now and dive into the development but remember to stay in touch with your investors at all times. Nothing big – share some updates and product-related news in emails and social media channels.
                                    <br>Why is it important? Because you have to make sure that the investors will be waiting at the exchange for your currency or tokens to pop up there.
                                    <br>Manage a healthy relationship and show that all goes well – they will buy more coin. Ruin the bridge of trust you’ve had and the investors will simply sell it all on day one thus effectively rendering your business useless even though you’ve raised the funds to start it.</p>

The entire creative process is made up of objective finding, data gathering, problem design, ideation, and selection. Understanding the role of each step enables us to ensure that we generate the most effective solutions. In this course, Stefan Mumaw guides us through the five steps and then shows us what the complete process looks like, with a real-world project: designing a website.</p>

                                    <p>I have always been passionate about technology and it takes a dear place in my heart. But there is one thing I enjoy more than learning about innovation, growth and progress. I love writing about it.  I take much pride in sharing my gained knowledge through rich, engaging and educating content.</p>

                                    <p>Luckily the stuff I love is my job so I am one of those lucky bastards who don’t have to “work” a day in their live.</p>
