                                <p>ICO looks like the new cool kid in the crowdfunding block/ But why did it gain enough traction to make almost a quarter of all earning in Bitcoin? Is it a good fit for your business and, if so, how to launch one successfully? The answers are at your fingertips.</p>

                                <h2 id="text1">Blockchain is more than Bitcoin!</h2>
                                <p>Bitcoin and other Altcoins are everywhere nowadays. The news and major media outlets publish new stories on a daily basis, new shops, companies and even governments choose to accept them as a valid currency and so on and so forth.</p>
                                <p>The price of the coin heats up the interest of the masses and creates new opportunities for entire communities of miners, traders and investors.</p>
                                <p>The media generates more news, the community grows even further, they pitch in and bring something new, the media writes about it and the cycle loops. No wonder that most of us only hear about Altcoin as it is a self-autonomous ecosystem compiled of viral content.</p>
                                <p>But the media can’t be the only reason for the popularity of Bitcoin and Altcoin. There was, after all, a time when no one new nor wrote about it at Forbes, the Huffington Post or Mashable. And yet it still grew high enough to attract that kind of attention.</p>
                                <p>What was it? What’s really juicing up the price of Bitcoin? The Blockchain network, of course. It is the real unsung hero.</p>
                                <h3 id="Section:BfB:Level:Expert:Course:1(Copy)-ThepoweroftheBlockchain">The power of the Blockchain</h3>
                                <p>But what makes the Blockchain network big enough for supporting coins to be worth several hundreds or even thousands of dollars?</p>
                                <p>Here is an example.</p>
                                <p>You have an iTunes account on your iPhone, don’t you? It is a digital asset, as you own something of value that is not real but composed entirely of bits and bytes. Well, can you imagine that before the introduction of Blockchain there was no way for validating your ownership?</p>
                                <p>Digital relationships were built entirely on trust. You trusted Apple to let you use <strong>your</strong> content on <strong>their</strong> servers after logging in with a valid username/password string. You simply had no choice but to trust your data into the hands of a corporation like Google, Apple, Facebook or Microsoft and, while those big guys have a reputation and seem like trustworthy enough, same cannot be said about other digital asset providers.</p>
                                <p>Just think about the amount of scams and phishing websites all over the internet that can take your money or time and give absolutely nothing in return.</p>
                                <p>This can never happen in the Blockchain network. No, not because it is more trustworthy than any other digital systems, but because it is the opposite of it. The Blockchain network is trustless (remember <span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="65f57a98-12d4-45ff-8bd0-41185de9efb8">our</span> talk about the smart contracts from the previous courses?). It simply has no need for such a vague concept.</p>
                                <p>Ok, digital assets aside, let’s talk ownership. Of what? Of anything and everything. Let’s imagine you have the stock of a company and you wish to sell it. What do you have to do today? Start with hiring a lawyer, prepare yourself for stacks of paperwork and brace the need in a centralized regulator or a third-party authority such as the NY Stock Exchange as those guys have the trust of the community.</p>
                                <p>All of those actions would take but a few clicks in a trustless Blockchain network. It simplifies the process of ownership transfers and, at the same time, it reduces the need for third party involvement (lawyers, regulators) to a nice, round zero.</p>
                                <p>So, as you can see, the Blockchain network is not about the money, or fees, or currency rates. <span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="929ee511-10cc-49f1-b30b-029122b9c86f">It is about smart contracts.</span> It is about a revolutionary way of trustless ownership transfers that can be applicable in any niche and that is the network’s primary value for prospering businesses.</p>
                                <h2 id="text2">Possible applications of Blockchain in business</h2>
                                <p>Ok, so we have the technology that supports smart contracts, or agreements set in computing stone between two parties. The terms of these agreements can be traced to their roots on every step of the journey. It is, indeed, a handy trick for making domestic or international transfers without involving a bank or paying it a commission. But so what? I’m not in the finance industry and I couldn’t care less about how payments or ownerships work as long as I get my mined coin into my account.</p>
                                <p>Or so you think.</p>
                                <p>But, in reality, the vagueness of such a concept as ownership opens up a lot of new business opportunities and possibilities across a plethora of industries. True, some, like finance, are more interesting to investors than others, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t build and run a successful business through doing the things you care about.</p>
                                <p>Let’s say that you like cars. Blockchain-based solutions currently have the highest demand in the automotive market.</p>
                                <h3 id="Section:BfB:Level:Expert:Course:1(Copy)-Automotive">Automotive</h3>
                                <p>Cars are getting smarter alongside all of the other tech that surrounds us in our daily lives. <span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="fb263309-780a-4f4f-87f5-e9aa8cb74e0b">37 million interconnected vehicles are expected to hit the market in the next five years or so</span>. Surely the niche is a goldmine for third-party connectivity service providers.</p>
                                <p>Let’s talk communications: there are generally three channels of communications that cars support. Vehicles need to connect to other vehicles, manufacturer’s servers and third party applications. This way they know about the situation on the road, get stable updates and can operate with everything from iTunes to Google apps for enhanced comfort of the driver as well as the passengers.</p>
                                <p>That’s a lot of required connectivity with colossal volumes of data transfers. Is there a better platform to solve these precise needs than Blockchain?</p>
                                <p>The platform that’s based on distributed computing gathers more juice from hundreds or thousands of devices. The network allows for superior distribution and storage of securely encrypted data in a way no other server ever could.</p>
                                <p>And, if data transfer, while being a testy benefit to both manufacturers and consumers, are not as irreplaceable as the security of the transaction and the stability of ownership. You don’t want for your car to be hacked and hijacked, do you?</p>

                                <p>Ok, maybe you are not that into cars. But do you like the new, fancy gadgets? Smart homes, smart lightbulbs, smart toasters and whatnot – all of those things make our lives easier.</p>
                                <p>Alas, they come with the same risks as the smart cars because of the nature of internet connectivity. Everything that goes live may be considered as compromised by default.</p>
                                <p>Blockchain’s encryption, however, allows for your toaster to make you a meal, not zap you with electricity and steal all of the money from your bank account.</p>

                                <p>Given that an asset of protected ownership can be anything from a car to a lightbulb to a string of data containing medical or financial records, the principles of Blockchain can be applied to any niche or industry. The examples above just serve as a taste of what the network is capable of.</p>
                                <p>And yet there is one thing that’s off in them as well as in the majority of data on the subject that’s available on the internet, that thing being a set of rules.</p>
                                <p>Here’s the thing: Blockchain is not a concept. It is a data management methodology, and, like with any other methodologies out there it is nothing but a set of recommendations you can bend or flex to your will.</p>
                                <p>Sure, if you’ll wish to build your solution based on any existing network like Ethereum or Bitcoin you will have to submit to the pre-set protocols. But here’s the thing – you don’t have to.</p>
                                <p>Anyone with enough skills and experience can build a Blockchain network from scratch. And that custom network will have it’s own unique rules and that, my friends, is the second real opportunity the technology provides to young and creative entrepreneurs.</p>
                                <p>Sounds like a dream come true? Yes, but the promise of technological freedom for building something of your own is reality. Don’t take just our word for it – take a look at success storied below.</p>

                                <h2 id="text4">Your guide to building a startup</h2>
                                <p>Don’t get this wrong – while the opportunities are definitely out there, the road towards becoming as successful entrepreneur is still filled with bumps and loopholes.</p>
                                <p>The worst part about starting something new is that there are no guides. It is impossible to make a step-by-step tutorial towards running a successful business. If it were as simple as follow 8 steps and start making millions – everyone would be a millionaire by now. The only thing that we can offer is for you not to repeat the mistakes of others on your path.</p>
                                <p>That’s right, this guide is not built on the things you should do to succeed That part is something you should figure out on your own. We will only twist the tables around to show what you really shouldn’t do.</p>
                                <h3 id="Section:BfB:Level:Expert:Course:1(Copy)-Don’tkeepitalltoyourself">Don’t keep it all to yourself</h3>
                                <p>Ideas are an amazing thing. A simple though can revolutionize the way the entire world works. What if people could fly? What if we could access a library from home? What if there was a place where we can watch all of the kitten videos at once? All of these thoughts led to revolutions in their respected universes because they were public. They chose to satisfy the needs of many.</p>
                                <p>Alas, in our day and age, most of these needs were already satisfied and the ideas modern startups have simply improve on what has been built earlier. This means that the entrepreneur cant really know if the improvement is needed or not as he is working with a system that has already proven it’s worth over time.</p>
                                <p>Share your ideas with peers, learn from their feedback and improve on their thoughts. This is the only way to find out if you have enough ground to stand on and keep digging deeper without falling.</p>
                                <h3 id="Section:BfB:Level:Expert:Course:1(Copy)-Don’tbethe“there’snoonelikeme”guy">Don’t be the “there’s no one like me” guy</h3>
                                <p>Here is a simple idea: everything that could have been invented has already been invented. If it wasn’t, than we currently don’t have the technical capabilities to do so. This can also be applied to your idea. If you have something that is worth making – the chances are that someone has already made it in one form or the other.</p>
                                <p>Check how other people make their businesses, what fuels their decisions, how their minds work. Investigate in success stories as much as you can before making something of your won. Follow the footsteps of the giants and you will grow bigger yourself.</p>
                                <h3 id="Section:BfB:Level:Expert:Course:1(Copy)-Don’tstoplearning">Don’t stop learning</h3>
                                <p>Classes, courses, books or blogs – the source is irrelevant for as long as you keep learning something new on a daily basis. We are not saying that all of the knowledge you consume has to be industry-related or business-specific. You never know where the new source of inspiration comes from.</p>
                                <p>History has countless examples of tech entrepreneurs borrowing ideas from art and likewise. Here’s an example: the SCRUM methodology that’s used by most modern software developers is both a football term and an adaptation of the “no waste” policies used by the Japanese car manufacturers.</p>
                                <p>Mission out on that one book about the adventures of Tom Sawyer may result in a butterfly effect of you not thinking about a better way for painting fences with blockchain-powered robots.</p>
                                <h2 id="text5">The needs of many</h2>
                                <p>Why do startups fail? If you were to look at the official stats, you’d know that the #1 reason is the lack of an audience AKA no market need. Yes, 42% of all startups die because they don’t have a community large enough to support them.</p>
                                <p>But how you tell if your idea is any different? How can you know that there are people interested in what you have to offer?</p>
                                <p>Through compelling audience analysis, of course.</p>
                                <p>Start with the simple basics: who do you think will be interested in your offerings? Are you making a product for men or women? What is their age? Where do they live?</p>
                                <p>The answers to all of these question are there, in your mind. For example, if it is the fence-painting robots than you know that your audience can either be government official willing to automate their services to the community and not random home owners. Why? Because their need for a painted fence once a year does not justify the purchase of an expensive robot.</p>
                                <p>Now that you know the audience, figuring out the age and gender isn’t much of a deal, is it? You can simply google the people you want and find out a precise answer.</p>
                                <p>Yes, our example is a tiny bit limited, but the principle works for any business model. Start small and use logic to discover more data.</p>
                                <h3 id="Section:BfB:Level:Expert:Course:1(Copy)-Competition">Competition</h3>
                                <p>Ok, now that we know what you are doing and who you are doing it for the time has come for some research. As it was said above – all that could have been invented by now is already invented. You have competition. Sure, your competitors might not have the exact same product. Let’s say that their robots trim bushes and cannot paint fences. But your audiences are fairly similar, aren’t they?</p>
                                <p>Great!</p>
                                <p>Now put on your spy hat ands start analyzing your competition. Who are they targeted at? How do they distribute their advertising budget? Who are they working with? Are they making enough profit to fuel their enterprise? Because if so, the odds are that you have an audience large enough to support you as well.</p>
                                <h2 id="text6"><span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="750e6a19-0b57-480e-b8c4-bb55d389b24e">Audience analysis</span></h2>
                                <p>Ok, now that we know that there is a need for your product, the time has come to talk about who needs it. No, not like we did before. This time we require serious details.</p>
                                <p>We’d recommend for you to craft a couple of buyer personas or imaginary customers that fit a specific profile.</p>
                                <p>Here is what you already have:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Name: Jerry (or whatever other name that is to your liking)</li>
                                    <li>Gender: male</li>
                                    <li>Age: 35-45 years old</li>
                                    <li>Annual income: $80K</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Looks great? Really? Tell me what are you going to do with this information? Write them a birthday card?</p>
                                <p>You see, all of your clients have needs, motivations and reasons that support purchasing decisions.</p>
                                <p>Our Jerry, for example, wants a promotion. And in order to get it he needs to do something awesome, right? I feel like reducing their annual spending on painting fences works well. And that is how you target Jerry – your marketing campaign should be aimed at solving this precise pain of your client.</p>
                                <p>This is how the real-deal customer profile looks like:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Name:</strong> Jerry</li>
                                    <li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li>
                                    <li><strong>Age:</strong> 35-45 years old</li>
                                    <li><strong>Annual income:</strong> $80K</li>
                                    <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Jerry is not very emotional in his decision making as all of the solutions he pitches to the table have to be approved by an authority and he can’t afford to waste their time. Jerry is looking for proven solutions with a successful track record of operations even if it means that the service provider will charge a bit more than the industry average.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Goals</strong>: Jerry needs an automation solution for his company. Jerry is interested in cutting expanses in the end. Jerry is expecting a solid ROI out of every invested dollar.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Frustrations:</strong> Jerry hates that a lot of service providers have little content on their site, Jerry hates that he has to read a lot about the things he doesn’t need, jerry hates that there are no sources or references that prove a concept</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>This client profile is a much more effective marketing tool. We know that Jerry is looking for quality products and that he can spend more on something worthwhile as he isn’t even spending his own money. Work with the frustrations: add client journeys and success stories to your site, allow for jerry to quickly hop into a live chat and train your managers to provide trustworthy answers to common questions and voila – you have Jerry as your loyal customer.</p>
                                <p>There is only one problem – we’ve made up the product and the client. And, while latter is somewhat acceptable, you can’t afford to build your client profiles on imagination or assumptions. You need real data that indicates the needs, motivations and frustrations of a person.</p>
                                <p>How to get the data you need?</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Try using surveys. There are a lot of them on every subject imaginable.</li>
                                    <li>Use custom analytics software from HubSpot to GA to Statista and more</li>
                                    <li>Engage in social media like Quora or reddit</li>
                                    <li>Talk to people, ask questions, give answers – you have the internet at your disposal!</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Now that you know all of the answers and you are aware of the reasoning for your decisions – the time has come to make your startup fly. Develop an MVP, attract the needed investors and go live. How can you do it? We will cover this subject in our next course!</p>

                                <p>The creative process isn't just "generating ideas." The reality is it's a five-step process, and ideation is only one of those steps. The entire creative process is made up of objective finding, data gathering, problem design, ideation, and selection. Understanding the role of each step enables us to ensure that we generate the most effective solutions. In this course, Stefan Mumaw guides us through the five steps and then shows us what the complete process looks like, with a real-world project: designing a website.</p>

                                    <p>I have always been passionate about technology and it takes a dear place in my heart. But there is one thing I enjoy more than learning about innovation, growth and progress. I love writing about it.  I take much pride in sharing my gained knowledge through rich, engaging and educating content.</p>

                                    <p>Luckily the stuff I love is my job so I am one of those lucky bastards who don’t have to “work” a day in their live.</p>
