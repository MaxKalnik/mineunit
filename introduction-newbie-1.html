                                </span></h2>

                                <p>Originally developed in 2008 to power Bitcoin, Blockchain technology has caught the attention and conquered the minds of millions since. The technology is massively used nowadays for cryptocurrency mining. trading, funding, and for other purposes.</p>

                                <p>The name of the technology is descriptive on its own as the technology is a set of blocks united into a chain. Each block is an encrypted record of new transactions. It is valuable because of its unique encryption where every block is displayed as a long string of characters. In theory, ways of combining characters into strings have a limit as there are only so many times one may use the same letters and digits.</p>

                                <p>FYI: the maximum number of blocks in Bitcoins' blockchain is 115,792,089,237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,853,269,984,665,640,564,039,457,584,007,913,129,639,935. The current number of blocks in the network is 523.966.</p>

                                <p>Just like with gold or diamonds it is the limitations of the resource that make it valuable.</p>

                                <p>Every crypto coin you possess is a lengthy sequence of symbols that no other user in the world can or will have. A device that crafts these unique encrypted sequences is a mining rig, as it pools the "digital gold” from the total pool of possible combinations, AKA “the mine”. Each block is a finished sequence. Each block is stable a part of the chain.</p><h3 id="CopyofSection:Introduction;Level:Newbie;Course:1-BlockchainVStraditionalbanking?"><strong>Blockchain VS traditional banking?</strong></h3>

                                <p>Now that you know the basics, it is time to understand the value and importance of Blockchain technology. Blockchain has a series of benefits over traditional banking operations. They were best illustrated by William Mougayar:</p>

                                <p>The blockchain is very much like Google Sheets. If you wish to collaborate with a person or a whole team you can create a document and work on it together in real time. Just create the sheet, send it over and ask for help - it’s as simple as that.</p>

                                <p>Sure there are some differences. For instance, if the Sheets were blockchain-based than each cell would be connected to the previous one and if you were to change the contents of it the cell would, in turn, affect the entire network. But for the sake of a better understanding, this analogy works pretty well.</p>

                                <p>This flow feels so natural nowadays, especially for those using Google Sheets on a regular basis. However, before they were invented, collaboration capabilities were limited. One had to create an MS Word doc, fill it with content, save the changes and send it over for the others to receive it, make the changes on their end, save, share, rinse and repeat.</p>

                                <p>And just like Google has revolutionized collaboration, so has Blockchain, but on a different level. You see, most servers today operate on a principle similar to MS Word. Data is entered, saved, shared. The process is rinsed and repeated by multiple parties on their end and only then is “the document” finished. One player, one change at a time.</p>

                                <p>With Blockchain the limitations are gone, as users have the power to both enter and see the changes in real time. In banking terms, a single transaction is simultaneously verified on both ends - the sender’s and the receiver's. That noted, blockchain also erases the need for the middleman or a regulatory authority as all the transactions are done on a peer-to-peer basis.</p>

                                <p><strong>A public ledger</strong></p>

                                <p>The pier-to-pier nature of the technology allows for much more than instant money transfers. The “middleman” or the bank is simply not needed for ongoing transactions between you or your friends, colleagues, employees, etc.</p>

                                <p>Yes, your transaction will be visible to the entire world in the open database of the blockchain, but neither you nor the recipient will be known as user data is safely encrypted. The meaningful amount of value transferred is the only thing the network will see.</p>

                                <p>Blockchain opens the doors to free financial transfers, just like the internet did back in the day for data transfers (sure there are some fees, but they can't even be compared to what the banking system charges).</p>

                                <p>Transaction fees depend on two factors: the rate of the fee (floating value that rises and falls in response to network transaction volume) and size of the transaction (in bytes). The average fee is $1 now.</p>

                                <p>For better or worse, everyone can enter the network and become an independent agent completely responsible for one’s finances without sharing any of them or the data related to them with any regulatory authority in the world.</p>

                                <p><strong>The price of Bitcoin</strong></p>

                                <p>Now that we’ve covered how blockchain and cryptocurrencies work on paper it is time to determine how mining for Bitcoin, Ethereum or any other currency works and why it is profitable.</p>

                                <p>As we have discussed above, the number of encrypted code sequences that are a combination capable of becoming a Bitcoin is limited. Is that it? Or is there anything else that makes Bitcoin an asset or a potential investment, because there are also currencies that do not have a cap, yet may be proud with a lot of monetary value.</p>

                                <p>Well, the basic rule of supply and demand has a play in it for sure, but cryptocurrencies are much more than just a limited supply. They are a supply of something people find value in - technology.</p>

                                <p>And, given how people’s idea of value is different, the price is regulated by a so-called shared opinion or data regarding the general state of the market. Buyers and sellers agree on the value which is fair and is based on the value of the cryptocurrency trading elsewhere.</p>

                                <p>This type of price evaluation is possible thanks to the open nature of the Blockchain where everyone is allowed to see every transaction. Given that the transactions are peer-to-peer, there are no additional costs like maintenance fees or credit card fees involved. There may be a transaction fee though.</p>

                                <p>Here is an example: Party A wishes to make a purchase that is worth, say $10.000. Party A knows that the seller accepts cryptocurrencies like, say Ethereum as a means of payment. The Party A would go to the Public Ledger to discover the current worth of Ethereum in order to convert the $10.000 into cryptocurrency. The party A finds the public Ethereum address on the seller’s website and sends the required amount of ETH to it. The transfer is done, both parties remain anonymous, but the public ledger is aware of the value, address and time of this transaction.</p>

                                <p>This is where the miners step in. As soon as party A submits the transaction, the miners are the ones to verify it within several minutes. As soon as the verification is complete, the given amount of Ethereum will be delivered to the seller.</p><h2 id="text2">Chapter 2: Mining</h2>

                                <p>Cryptocurrency mining can be broken down into two components. One is the process of adding transactions into the network like in the example above. It is the miner’s job to decrypt and verify the transaction. The second component of mining is essentially the creation of new currency units or blocks. Computers with extreme calculative capabilities are used to generate sequences of encrypted code on an ongoing basis. Individual blocks made by miners contain the P-O-W or the Proof of Work certificate.</p>

                                <p>A miner requires a powerful computer setup and specialized software in order to compute insanely difficult mathematical sequences. This process is also known as “solving blocks”.</p>

                                <p>A block is solved via cryptographic hash functions. The Hash value is a numeric value of fixed length that uniquely identifies data.</p>

                                <p>Mining involves the use of computers to run hashing algorithms to process the most recent block. All the information needed for mining is found in the block's header which contains the block version number, a timestamp, the hash used in the previous block, the hash of the Merkle Root, the nonce, and the target hash. A block will be generated by taking hash from header contents, adding random nonce and hashing it again.</p>

                                <p>Mining is the process of finding this nonce, which will make the generated block hash less or equal to last accepted block hash.</p>

                                <p>Or, in simpler words, miners use their computer to zero in on a hash value that's less than the target, and whoever is the first to crack it would be considered the one who mined the block and is eligible to get a reward. The current reward for mining a block is currently worth 12.5 Bitcoin (+the fees per transaction included in the block).</p>

                                <p>Wow, 12.5 Bitcoin is a lot of money in US dollars! Why doesn't everybody do it then? The answer lies in the very way the profit is gained: a lot of miners have invested a lot of money into technically advanced setups of heavy computing machinery. The block requires a combination of their efforts to crack, meaning all of them are in the same boat. But, when the block finally cracks, only one of those miners lucky enough to get the last bites is THE ONLY ONE getting the reward.</p>

                                <p>In other words, Bitcoin mining is an exhausting, time- and resource-intensive activity that requires immediate investments and constant involvement, while the profit won’t be yours to claim for a very long time.</p>

                                <p>Not only that but the existing GPUs aren't powerful enough!</p>

                                <p>Miners are flocking to application-specific integrated circuits or ASICs. To circumvent this shortcoming, Nvidia and AMD are said to be working on GPUs, which could be used specifically for the purpose. These GPUs, however, are yet to come and your mining rig has to be fueled right now.</p>

                                <p>Sure, products like our mineunit can solve a lot of these issues with hand-picked hardware and we also reduce your involvement to a bare “plug and earn” minimum, but even then mining is not a walk in the park.</p>

                                <p>But, for the sake of the narrative let us presume that you have successfully mined a plentiful amount of cryptocurrencies. What are your next steps? Sleep on the coins or make more profit? This is where crypto trading steps in.</p>

                                <p>Do note that we’ve barely touched the subject of mining here in order to display how it relates to crypto trading. A lot more knowledge will be revealed in chapter 3 and other mining-specific courses available in the academy. Stay tuned!</p><h2 id="text3">

                                <span class="inline-comment-marker valid" data-ref="e5f9a0fb-1ab4-46b9-bc2c-233c26c8ae7a">Chapter 3: Practical Mining
                                </span></h2>

                                <p>Now that the basics of mining are covered and you know where Blockchain stands, the time has come for practical mining lessons. Or has it?</p>

                                <p>In reality, there is a question that demands an answer before one may proceed into the realm of crypto mining, that question being: what are you mining for?</p>

                                <p>The obvious answer - money is not as obvious when it comes to real deal crypto mining. The process is simply too time-consuming and investment-intensive for a beginner to make real profits.</p>

                                <p>Attention dear learners, a tough reality punch is heading your way:</p>

                                <p>If you are looking at mining as a hobby or a source of additional income, and your investment budget is around $1000, you will face a steady income of +/- $2 per day. You will have to wait for about 18 months to get your first dollars in ROI (Return on Investment).</p>

                                <p>That noted, if we were to talk about making a living from crypto mining, your investment pool would have to cover $5000+ up-front for hardware alone. An investment on such a scale may lead to $50 per day in profit, which is not going to make you a millionaire but is enough to pay the bills, which is nice.</p>

                                <p>The middle ground between the two is probably the best fit for a beginner miner: an investment in 4 GPU video cards with a power source capable of juicing the rig at less than $0.11 per kilowatt-hour will bring in eight to ten dollars daily.</p>


                                <p>What, crypto mining doesn't look as romantic as the internet told you it is? Sorry for bringing the harsh truth, but at least now you have straightforward expectations that bring us to a crossroads.</p>


                                <p>If you wish to make more money with lesser investments but a higher risk - forget about mining rigs and focus on trading.</p>

                                <p>If you are still into mining because of the sheer fascination with hardware, software and the chance to bring up your own working unit is a big enough reward on its own, let us proceed.</p>

                                <p><strong>A mining rig</strong></p>

                                <p>A mining rig is more than just hardware. You will also require a lot of software in order to mine, store coin, and withdraw money successfully. The first thing to worry about is a digital wallet.</p><h3 id="CopyofSection:Introduction;Level:Newbie;Course:1-HotVSColdWallets"><strong>Hot VS Cold Wallets</strong></h3>

                                <p>A crypto wallet is pretty much a self-explanatory term. It stands for a digital wallet designed to store your currencies safely.</p>

                                <p>Crypto wallets can be divided into two types: hot and cold. The difference between the two lies in their connectivity to the internet or the lack of it in the first place. Cold wallets, AKA cold storages, are basically the equivalent of a banking vault storing physical cash. They are offline at all times and provide a better level of security, as the only way to break into them is physical. A hacker would have to get through doors, layers of metal and hardware casings in order to get to the soft belly of the device, and that, as you may imagine, is harder than hacking a mobile phone or an Ashley Madison server.</p>

                                <p>On the other hand, security levels of a cold storage make it hard to access the currency even for the owner. You will not be able to freely trade or invest your assets, hence this type of wallet is not a good fit for crypto trading or currency exchange but is rather intended to store colossal volumes of value like any other vault.</p>

                                <p>A hot wallet is opposite to a cold wallet. It is much more user-friendly and connected to the internet, meaning asset management is available at your fingertips. Invest, trade, win or lose profit from the comfort of your couch - that is what a hot wallet offers.</p><h3 id="CopyofSection:Introduction;Level:Newbie;Course:1-Miningsoftware"><strong>Mining software</strong></h3>

                                <p>Very much like a PC is just an overly expensive box without an operating system that runs useful programs, a mining rig is a combination of chips and wires without mining software.</p>

                                <p>Your best bet would be to go for a free mining package from AMD (or any other package of your liking) that consists of stratum and cgminer.</p>

                                <p>You will also need online-based software like a membership in an at least one currency exchange service, access to a mining pool, etc.</p>

                                <p>The currency exchange software is required for you to trade cryptocurrencies into other cryptocurrencies, because not all of them can be converted into fiat money, and it is usually easier to mine the ones that can not be converted.</p>

                                <p>A mining pool will allow you to unite efforts with other miners in order to speed things up a bit and earn coin quicker. Do note that the current state of things in the niche practically nullifies the efforts of solo miners, thus uniting together into a pool is the best way to go. Mining pools will be covered in more detail shortly.</p>

                                <h3 id="CopyofSection:Introduction;Level:Newbie;Course:1-Mininghardware"><strong>Mining hardware</strong></h3>

                                <p>The GPU or a specialized ASIC Chip (a mining-oriented analog of a video card/CPU) is the heart of your rig. It will be responsible for executing the hash function, verification of transactions in Blockchain, and essentially mining your own coin. That does not mean, however, that ASIC or GPU chips are all you need.</p>

                                <p>For starters, you will need a custom made PC (gaming consoles or mobile devices won’t do the trick) that consist of a power block, a motherboard, the CPU, RAM memory, a hard drive, a custom cooling system, and the GPU itself.</p>

                                <p>Why can’t you use your own PC or laptop for mining?</p>
                                <ol>
                                <li>A) Because it takes the entirety of the device’s computing power, meaning you will not be able to use the device for anything else other than mining.</li>
                                <li>B) A run in the mill PC (not to mention a laptop) isn't designed for mining. The built-in cooling system won’t do the trick. Your device will overheat and potentially melt, thus stopping the additional income as well as the device’s long being. A gaming PC with water cooling could handle the heat, however, it is too expensive to be considered a worthwhile mining investment as, while staying cool, it will run the hash function much slower than a custom built rig designed with mining in mind.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p>The third element of the perfect mining rig does not come from either hardware or software components, and yet it is as important as the two. We are, of course, talking about the spacing of the rig. Even a custom rig generates a lot of heat and noise, hence it has to be placed in a cool, well-ventilated area. A basement should do the trick. If you do not have a basement, invest in two or three additional air fans and a nice pair of earplugs.</p>

                                <p>Not to brag, but we’ve dealt with spacing and heating issues in our own mineunit, so if you are experiencing a lack of space to build a rig on, give us a call.</p><h3 id="CopyofSection:Introduction;Level:Newbie;Course:1-Miningsetups"><strong>Mining setups</strong></h3>

                                <p>A mining rig is essentially an amalgamation of hardware and software components that are designed to mine cryptocurrencies. We get that already.</p>

                                <p>What we don't know yet is that specific types of hardware work better with certain currencies than others. Your knowledge of the niche and the currency of your choice are to dictate the perfect mining rig components, but we can recommend some of the more newbie-friendly mixups.</p>

                                <p><strong>Bitcoin</strong></p>

                                <p>Don’t. Just don’t bother with Bitcoin mining, as your budget is probably insignificant to get even a crumb off this table. As of lately, Bitcoin mining is reserved for industrial grade hardware backed by thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>

                                <p><strong>Ethereum</strong></p>

                                <p>Expected to shortly become Bitcoin’s successor, this currency is still newbie-friendly. Ethereum is generated via mining Ether, or, in simpler words, ensuring the encryption of transactions in the Blockchain network. Given how transactions are not going anywhere, and they need to stay protected, Ethereum is one of the smartest bets when it comes to investment choices.</p>

                                <p>Mining of Ethereum requires the same hardware pieces that any PC has. The GPU has to possess at least 2 gigabytes of ram and is generally performing better than a CPU. Make it your #1 priority.</p>

                                <p>The rewards come at 5 Ether per every block. The reward is fixed.</p>

                                <p><strong>Litecoin</strong></p>

                                <p>Litecoin is an open source P2P currency that grows faster than the entire rabbit population of New Zealand combined. It works well with a standard PC build and does not require investments in ASIC. The build can be the same as an Ethereum-oriented one, and the

                                </span>.</p>

                                <p><strong>Dash</strong></p>

                                <p>As these words were written, 

                                <span class="inline-comment-marker valid" data-ref="192c256c-145e-4267-bf38-3774ff7c8bed">Dash has skyrocketed through the $2 Billion market cap and a single token was worth as much as $300
                                </span>. Given the looks of things this trend is going to stick for a while, hence Dash is as nice a place for beginners as any. The rewards are taunting with the 1.8 Dash per each block, however, the hash rate of 358 Mh/s and the x11 algorithm make mining resource-intensive. A simple GPU is not enough!</p>

                                <p>ASIC-based processor mining should be your go-to solution when it comes to Dash and it would be best for you to work in a mining pool for better results.</p>

                                <p>This concludes an introduction into the realm of mining and this course will head towards shedding light on cryptocurrency trading.

                                <p>Before we can proceed to education on actual cryptocurrency trading there are two things you have to understand:</p>

                                <p>As mentioned above, crypto trading may be rewarding, and given the nature of the market as well as its novelty, one may easily become rich overnight. That noted, one may also lose it all over the same course of time. Trading without AI algorithms that back up data-driven decisions is a risk. Even with them, it is still a risk, though a smaller one. This is why we warn you - never invest more money into a trade than you can afford to lose. This mindset is critical.</p>

                                <p>Trading cryptocurrencies and trading cryptocurrency stocks are two different forms of trading. We are covering the earlier in this course while the latter is no different than regular stock trading and requires education that is specific to the stock trading niche.</p>

                                <p><strong>Trading essentials</strong></p>

                                <p>What does one need to become a trader? Not much, really. Becoming a great trader will take much more, but we will get to that later on. For now, we are going to discover the essentials:</p>

                                <p>An access to a trading platform and a crypto wallet that serves as the storage of assets are all it takes for you to begin.</p>

                                <p>1) A simple wallet</p>

                                <p>2) A multisig wallet</p>

                                <p>3) A multicurrency wallet</p>

                                <p><strong>Types of trading</strong></p>

                                <p>Trading can be divided into groups by the benefits you are planning to receive and the currencies you are willing to trade.</p>

                                <p>If talking value we can speak about long-term vs short-term trading.</p>

                                <p>Long-term trading is a safer bet as it is based on planning and overall market analysis. Buyers invest in those currencies they believe will be worth more in perspective. If you believe that Bitcoin will be worth much more in a year than it is today, and have the data supporting the statement, you are to invest in Bitcoin and keep on to your coin for as long as possible.</p>

                                <p>The largest spook here is that the market is a rollercoaster. The risks of falling victim to a popped bubble are high and so are the risks of losing it all because even if the currency drops in price you are to keep it in your wallet alongside the hopes in the situation's stabilization over the course of several months. Needless to say, the situation may or may not stabilize.</p>

                                <p>Short-term trading is based on the quickness of one’s reaction and the ability to keep the finger on the pulse of the industry 24/7/365. 

                                <span class="inline-comment-marker valid" data-ref="a7ba609e-36f1-4ba3-ab0d-c57e82e1b45b">As soon as a currency rises, you are to buy, and as soon as it flunks you are to sell.
                                </span> The nature of this type of trading involves moderately small investments and is perfect for beginners. Sure, you will be getting less value per every successful investment simply because of its size but look at the bright side - 

                                <span class="inline-comment-marker valid" data-ref="4773b866-7dec-4492-bd6c-013482ebafd9">there is no limit to the transactions
                                </span>! Watch out for fees though.&nbsp;</p>

                                <p><strong>The value of a currency</strong></p>

                                <p>There are a lot of cryptocurrencies out there and, as always, where there is diversity there is also a difference in value. Some currencies like Bitcoin are famous and worthwhile (at least for now), while others are just getting out of the shadows with plans for global domination, and the third are permanently forgotten and gather dust in the worthless-land.</p>

                                <p>How can you, as a trader, tell which one is a worthwhile investment?</p>

                                <p>The answer’s both complex and simple at the same time. The simplicity of it lies in the fact that, while being different, all of the currencies follow the same rules and can be analyzed via the same set of parameters. The complexity lies in actually analyzing these currencies without making a mistake.</p>

                                <p>To make it easier for you we will provide a series of factors our own. AI algorithms pay attention to while evaluating the worth of a currency and its long-term perspectives:</p>

                                <p>How fast is the transaction speed? The higher it is, the more miners are working with the currency, solving the blocks and verifying the transactions, thus increasing the value.</p>

                                <p>What is the total supply of the currency available for trade? Less means more in the supply to demand chain. That is true. But of what worth is a currency unit none can get their hands on?</p>

                                <p>What is more important than the current supply is whether there will be a total cap limit to the currency or not. How big are the players investing in this particular currency? If you see some of the really loud names talking about your coin, the odds are that the top players have made their bets and expect a rise in demand. Note that this window of opportunity is usually extremely short and is the precise time-frame you need to both invest and withdraw in.</p>

                                <p>And, lastly, you have to answer whether there is a need for this particular currency in the first place, because if not, it will be consumed by larger players, sooner rather than later.</p>

                                <p><strong>Practical trading</strong></p>

                                <p>Now that we’ve covered the theory, the time has come for a little bit of practical advice. How does actual trading work?</p>

                                

                                <p><strong>Stage 1:</strong></p>

                                <p>Get your hands on base currency. Yes, there are more than 

                                <span class="inline-comment-marker valid" data-ref="4cfc2b87-5851-46dc-8338-2e54f39b015d">1.2000
                                </span> types of cryptocurrencies. None of them, however, may be purchased with real money. The only way to get in is through the purchase of Bitcoin. It can be bought with your typical currencies,&nbsp;like USD or EUR. Purchase it and you have your golden ticket into the industry.</p>

                                <p>Open an account in a crypto exchange platform of your liking (please check its background and look for real user reviews in advance) and trade your local currency for Bitcoin.</p>

                                <p>Do note that some local exchange platforms also allow you to purchase Litecoin or Ethereum. These currencies are experiencing a rise in demand right now, but are significantly cheaper than Bitcoin, so if your budget is not that great and the option is available, go for ETH or LTC.</p>

                                <p><strong>Stage2:</strong></p>

                                <p>Open an account in a currency exchange platform that only accepts cryptocurrencies. Do your homework and research the platform beforehand, just like you did in stage 1. Such an account will allow you to purchase currencies for your initial amount of BTC, ETH or LTC.</p>

                                <p><strong>Stage 3: Trade!</strong></p>

                                <p>Now that you have the right accounts and wallets, set up the time for the action has finally come. Feel free to trade fiat (paper) or crypto money to your heart’s content. You can do it in either stage 1 or stage 2.</p>

                                <p>Trading on stage 1 is easier. For the sake of the example, let us assume that the price per 1 Bitcoin is $20.000. Investing $1K into it will get you 0.05 worth of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin was to rise in price by 100% and its worth is $40.000, then so would your investment. Congrats, you’ve just made $2K from a thousand dollars.</p>

                                <p>Stage 2, AKA Pair Trading trading is trickier but, potentially more rewarding. You see, the odds of Bitcoin skyrocketing by 100% overnight are minimal, and yet in the realm of 1200+ other currencies, the sky's the limit.</p>

                                <p>With a base currency (BTC, LTC, ETH) on your hands, you can purchase any other digital currency. The tricky part is predicting the value, as you will both need to know what you enter the market with (current price of Bitcoin at this very second) and the value of the currency you are to purchase. Then and only then can you trade wisely.</p>

                                <p>This sums up the introduction into the world of crypto trading. If you are looking to find more tips, and practical know-how, feel free to enroll in our next course, which covers the subject in richer detail.</p><h2 id="text5">

                                <p>The blockchain isn't just a fine way to make a profit. The system has revolutionized the realm of business development as we know it. The best part is, given how fresh blockchain is compared to other commonly used technologies, one can still pioneer his way into an entire business empire starting with something as little as a single startup.</p>

                                <p>Need proof? Just take a look at Mineunit!</p>

                                <p>Ok, jokes aside, what are the most demanded business applications of Blockchain right now other than mining or crypto trading?</p>

                                <p><strong>QA</strong></p>

                                <p>QA or Quality Assurance is the process in which a business assures the quality of products or services. Blockchain can revolutionize the industry via being an open ledger with track records of every transaction available to any player at any given moment of time.</p>

                                <p>If something was to go wrong, the issue would be traced to its roots within moments.</p>

                                

                                <p><em>"Events like a salmonella scare could be traced back to the source in seconds, and every single bag from that batch would be flagged for removal, whether it be freshly packed in the processing plant, in a truck being delivered, or in the retail store already. This system could notify everyone involved in seconds rather than days,"</em> - Mike Almeida, president of Empire ATM Group.</p>

                                <p>Development of a solution for this industry is highly demandable and beneficial to both the business and end-consumers.</p>

                                <p><strong>Smart Contracts</strong></p>

                                <p>How would you like a contract that can not be broken? And what if that contract also does not require regulations or involvement of third-parties from lawyers to governments? More on the matter - the contracts are encrypted in a way that protects both the receiver and the recipient and construction of it is a matter of seconds.</p>

                                <p>Sounds like a dream come true for any business, does it not?</p>

                                <p>The logic of a smart&nbsp;

                                </span> (its subject) is embedded into an open ledger network, thus ensuring that a transaction is always received after the requirements are met. The service provider can safely provide products or services in advance knowing that as soon as they hit the shelf the payment will be delivered. The recipient is sure that he only pays for a service well-delivered.</p>

                                <p>Blockchain offers a new economy based on mutual trust, and that trust can not be broken even if one of the parties wishes to (whether by intent or not). Wow!</p>

                                <p><strong>E-Voting, Booking, and Confirmation</strong></p>

                                <p>Blockchain has offered one of the most stable, fast, responsive, and decentralized databases designed for reaching a consensus in the form of the DPOS Database (Delegated Proof of Stake)</p>

                                <p><em>“DPOS leverages the power of stakeholder approval voting to resolve consensus issues in a fair and democratic way. All network parameters, from fee schedules to block intervals and transaction sizes, can be tuned via elected delegates. Deterministic selection of block producers allows transactions to be confirmed in an average of just one second. Perhaps most importantly, the consensus protocol is designed to protect all participants against unwanted regulatory interference.”</em> -BitShare</p>

                                <p>These are but a handful of potential business applications Blockchain offers. Care to learn more? Because we are developing courses on Distributed Computing, Blockchain capabilities for business, an introduction into the ICO and more. Check them out!</p>
