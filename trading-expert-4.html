                                <p>What can be better than money? A whole lot of money! Luckily, the volatility of Bitcoin allows for smart and savvy traders to make a lot of cash. How? What are the most common pitfalls to avoid and challenges to overcome? Learn the answers from the course below!</p>


                                <h2 id="text1"><strong>What on Earth are trading pairs?</strong></h2>
                                <p><span>Dearest friends, the time has come to conclude our series of crypto trading courses. But let us not end on a sad note, but rather engage with more knowledge that can make your wallet beefier. Crypto Currency Pairs should do the trick just fine as they probably bring in the largest share of trading profits.</span></p>
                                <p><span><span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="69514495-9a10-446a-973e-c7b0782c17d1">What is trading in pairs?</span> It is a trade that does not require any involvement from fiat currencies. Let’s say you’ve traded Ether for Bitcoin and that would be a trading pair. It matters little which was the currency you bought or sold – the pair works both ways.</span>
                                </p>
                                <p><span>This opens an entirely new field of operations for traders as you can go 100% digital currency and make a huge profit from newly emerging coins.</span></p>
                                <p><span>Why bother?</span></p>
                                <p><span>Imagine you have both Bitcoin and cash. The cash is irrelevant and, just in case, I do not mean Bitcoin Cash. I am talking about the good old US dollars or Swiss Francs or whatever. What matters is that having both is fine and dandy by all standards… Until you wish to purchase, say, Litecoin. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                                <p><span>It’s not that you can’t buy Litecoin with cash. You can (<span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="dc4155a5-226f-47ae-a523-6d59eb81922d">although there are a lot of strictly digital trade currencies</span>). That is not the point. The point is the volatility of the cryptocurrencies. Let’s assume that your Bitcoin, all of a sudden, jumps in price by 5%, 10%, or even 20%. With that kind of money, you can purchase 5%, 10% and 20% more of Litecoin accordingly while the cash you own stays at the same point.</span>
                                </p>
                                <p><span>Same goes both ways and truly shines in the buy low sell high paradigm.</span></p>
                                <p><span>Still doesn’t make sense to you? Who cares if you have 10% more of Litecoin if the equivalent to US dollars is the same? Well, you should as you firmly believe that Litecoin will go up in price in the near future and you will be able to sell it for more cash.</span></p>
                                <p><span>How can you know that? Because you are a smart trader and you have performed both types of analysis discussed in the earlier courses.</span></p>
                                <p>
                                    <br>
                                </p>
                                <h2 id="text2"><strong>The deeper waters</strong></h2>
                                <p><span>Earlier we discussed massive trading platforms like the GDAX. They are amazing, safe, liable and all that stuff but there is one major problem with <span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="25976636-4f81-472f-89d9-bf4f5ec857f4">massive currency exchange platforms – they offer little choice</span>. If you only wish to stick with the big three of Ether, Bitcoin, and Litecoin – stick around. Two of the three can be easily formed into cash and you can always drive more fiat into your wallet flawlessly.</span>
                                </p>
                                <p><span>That noted, the deeper you go down into the rabbit hole, the more surprised you will be to see that other exchangers simply do not have an option of crypto to fiat exchange. What they have are a thousand other currencies that love to stick to the Altcoin market and some of those coins, like TRON, are breathtaking.</span></p>
                                <p><span>Lesser-known exchange platforms offer more flexibility and faster access to newly released coins where pairs like BTC to TRON make millions for traders. That flexibility, in turn, comes with a drawback – you keep trusting new brands with your money. Some of them may not be as safe as others.</span></p>
                                <p><span>Those who’ve read the previous courses and know how to choose a solid, trustworthy trading platform easily mitigate this issue. If you still haven’t, please give the previous courses a shot before proceeding any further.</span></p>
                                <h2 id="text3"><strong>A detailed guide to pair trading</strong></h2>
                                <p><span>If you are anything like me, you’ve probably poked your nose around all kinds of trading platforms because “how hard can it be? I’ll figure everything out on my own”. Well, my figuring out by myself process has cost me a couple thousand dollars and a generally overwhelming feeling that crypto trading is not for me. Then, and only then I’ve started to research the subject and learn from the mistakes of others.</span></p>
                                <p><span>I hope that you have found this course after being overwhelmed and not after wasting money down the drain, hence my main job is to break through the dizzy head. That one is easy. That one I can do through starting with the basics.</span></p>
                                <h2 id="Section:Trading.Level:Expert,Course:4(Copy)-Step1:Purchasingsomecoin"><strong>Step 1: Purchasing some coin</strong></h2>
                                <p><span>Ok, this one is easy enough and I have talked about it a lot already. Go to a large exchange like the GDAX and buy some crypto. Open up a wallet and store the coin there. That’s all simple and easy, right? If you still need any tips, check<span>&nbsp;</span></span><em><span><span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="85132d99-d8d5-4d87-b742-5d79a44ac2b1">here</span></span></em><span>.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Wait what? But I already have a GDAX account, you say? Well, as it was said above, one account is not enough. You will need to research an exchange platform that operates with Altcoins, not fiat currencies.</span></p>

                                <p><span>Now that all of your wallets and profiles are set up the time has come to talk worth. You will need to understand the pair value, meaning you have to find out how many coins you have now and how much can you make later. The thing is – on step 1 exchange platforms the price of your coin is quoted in fiat. If you have 1 Bitcoin you always know its worth in USD. This doesn’t work the same with pair trading, as most of the Altcoins will be quoted in other Altcoins. For example, <span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="057e06f5-6476-434d-86b9-93f79b964483">1 TRON may be worth 0.05 Bitcoin</span>. How much is that in USD? You’ll have to find that out on your own.</span>
                                </p>
                                <h2 id="Section:Trading.Level:Expert,Course:4(Copy)-Step4:Pairstocash"><strong>Step 4: Pairs to cash</strong></h2>
                                <p><span>Given that there are <span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="aecfa438-db78-45cc-9f1d-d05ec76486cf">1600+ Altcoin</span>s available, it is simple to get lost. And, as noted from the previous step, your job as a trader is to keep your finger on the pulse of your wallet manually. What this means is that if you Buy TRON for Bitcoin you stop monitoring the worth of TRON in Bitcoin and start monitoring its worth in USD.</span>
                                </p>
                                <p><span>Why would you do that? The market is volatile and sure, your 1 TRON can grow to 1 Bitcoin in value someday, but why did that happen? Because the new currency was successful or because Bitcoin simply flopped?</span></p>
                                <p><span>And here is the major difference for you, as a trader. You did not come here as an enthusiast that supports new currencies. You came to make money through buying and selling. And money (at least for the next couple of years) is fiat. This mindset is crucial in pairs trading.</span></p>
                                <h2 id="Section:Trading.Level:Expert,Course:4(Copy)-Step5:findapair"><strong>Step 5: find a pair</strong></h2>
                                <p><span>Ok, this one is easier said than done, Given the sheer volume of Altcoin, you can’t imagine any digital source on the planet telling you which ones are better than the others. The thing is – even if, by any chance, anyone managed to find the perfect pair – that someone won’t have the chance to share the knowledge. There simply isn’t enough time as new, better (or worse) currencies pop up by the minute.</span></p>
                                <p><span>This leaves us with the only viable choice for picking a pair: confidence in your decisions. How can you be 100% confident in that your current choice is correct? Start by answering a few simple questions:</span></p>

                                <h3 id="Section:Trading.Level:Expert,Course:4(Copy)-Haveareason"><strong>Have a reason</strong></h3>
                                <p><span>Measure seven times and only cut once. As said above and in all of my previous courses, the only choice for you to succeed as a trader is if your every trade is based on clear analysis. Why? Because of the nature of trading: it is a ruthless brawl. Just think about it – what happens when the price for the coin goes down? Yes, you have the chance to buy low (or ignore the deal) but the current owners of the coin have but one option. They have to sell. Or they will lose money.</span></p>
                                <p><span>In trading, every dollar you’ve gained is a dollar another trader has lost. Which side do you want to be on?</span></p>
                                <h3 id="Section:Trading.Level:Expert,Course:4(Copy)-Setcleargoals"><strong>Set clear goals</strong></h3>
                                <p><span>Your every trade is a unique activity that is independent of any other trades you make. This is why you have to set clear targets for every one of them bad boys. Although, in our case, because of all the risks around you are to have both positive and negative goals. If the currency of your choice is on the rise – great. Sell or stick until it grows even further.</span></p>

                                <p><span>What is FOMO? The Fear Of Missing Out. This fear is the scourge of all traders. I mean, how can one not buy a fancy coin everyone is talking about? How can you not if that darn candle is teasing you with its delightful green color?</span></p>
                                <p><span>Simple. You have to focus and remember that the brightest days only happen before a storm. If everyone and their mother is talking, buying, cheering for their smart investment choice – this is a sure signal that there soon won’t be anyone left willing or capable of buying the coin. And what happens when no one is buying? The price goes down and, trust me, you do not want to get into that boat.</span></p>

But is rather making a hell of a lot of deals that are worth tiny bitsy crumbs of money. And then, from the crumbs, that trader builds a fortune one penny at a time. What will happen if a loss occurs? Nothing, because a lot of other assets are making a profit. And that, my friends, is how you trade like a pro.</span></span>

                                <p><span>Now that we’ve covered the theory, the time has come to talk practical tips.</span></p>
                                <p><span>- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to get on top of a soon-to-be bullish market? Monitor the news. As soon as the first news from smaller publications hit the big news guys like Forbes, the time is ripe to make your move. After a lot of coverage the volumes of buyers will rise thus skyrocketing the price of the coin. Do note that if you miss your chance, even by one day, the odds are you will be entering a soon-to-be bearish market.</span></p>
                                <p><span>- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More profit is less profit. There will always be those dreaded times when you sell your coin and make a profit but then, out of nowhere, the price of the coin you just sold skyrockets. The key here is to remain calm and count the chickens you have. Risk buying again and welcome to the scenario from the first tip – the land of red candles.</span></p>
                                <p><span>- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fees bite. Especially if you are on the short-term side of trading. The only thing to minimize your expenses would be to not buy from the order book. You’ve set your goals a few steps ago. Remember? Well, use them to post the command and not the order. In this case you will only purchase when the coin meets your expectations of profitability. And if it doesn’t? You always have the stop-loss, remember?</span></p>

                                <p>The creative process isn't just "generating ideas." The reality is it's a five-step process, and ideation is only one of those steps. The entire creative process is made up of objective finding, data gathering, problem design, ideation, and selection. Understanding the role of each step enables us to ensure that we generate the most effective solutions. In this course, Stefan Mumaw guides us through the five steps and then shows us what the complete process looks like, with a real-world project: designing a website.</p>
